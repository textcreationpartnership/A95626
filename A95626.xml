            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Heſe are the times foretold wherein there ſhall be a fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling away, and defection from the Faith, as a meere fore-run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the great and terrible Day.</p>
            <p>And there are many falſe Prophets ariſen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, whoſe ſtudy and labour is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive poore ſoules, if it were poſſible even the very Elect.</p>
            <p>Men confident in an arme of fleſh, <hi>Goliah</hi>-like, defying the whole Iſrael of God. Some of
<pb facs="tcp:168495:3"/>which number we have to deale with, as may appeare in the enſuing Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not much regard how I be eſteemed of in the world for engaging in the quarrell. Applauſe ſhould not ſwell us, and diſpraiſe ſhould not deject us, neither greatneſſe affright us.</p>
            <p>When the glory of God lies at ſtake, and his truth oppoſed, his people muſt not ſtand by with a guilty ſilence, but are bound by many obligations to defend the truth, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand gain-ſayers.</p>
            <p>For my ſelfe, I am neither worthy of note, nor noted the unworthieſt, I confeſſe, amongſt the thouſands of <hi>Levi.</hi> But though I be the meaneſt of Gods ſervants, yet my witneſſe is in heaven I have ever deſired to doe the beſt ſervice I could in Gods Church.</p>
            <p>And this part I preſume to preſent to thoſe that deſire to fear the Lord, not begging Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage from Greatneſſe. (For what is good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves acceptance; and wherein I erre, I deſire pardon, not defence.)</p>
            <p>The occaſion of the publication hereof was a Diſpute, or rather Conteſt lately betwixt one Dr. <hi>Drayton,</hi> and one Mr. <hi>Parker,</hi> domeſtique
<pb facs="tcp:168495:3"/>Chaplaine to the Earle of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> at <hi>Wilton</hi> in the County of <hi>Wilts,</hi> and my ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Where in the publique Congregation they ſtood up, endeavouring to beat down the truth of the following Poſitions, and to maintain the contrary, as may appear by the proceedings betwixt the Doctor and my ſelfe, which I have placed at the beginning.</p>
            <p>Now although the points in controverſie have been ſo fully and clearly aſſerted and vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated by the Worthies of bleſſed memory, and by our yet living Reverend Clergie; That to any, not puft up with ſpirituall pride, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion of addition may ſeem ſuperfluous and unneceſſary.</p>
            <p>And notwithſtanding although <hi>dici non po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt quod non dictum eſt priùs;</hi> Yet in regard there are many people that have been much diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed and diſ-ſetled by reaſon of the audaciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and impudence of the oppoſers of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing truths, and many of them are not able to buy Volumes:</p>
            <p>Neither by reaſon of the weakneſſe of their capacities can ſo readily apprehend the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuity and clearneſſe of the truths upon the hearing of them; nor yet eaſily diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<pb facs="tcp:168495:4"/>them and Falſhood, vayled under Truth's vizard.</p>
            <p>I have therefore for their ſatisfaction and confirmation in the truth, preſented unto the publique ſome few collections; which being ſeriouſly weighed and digeſted, I doubt not by the bleſsing of God may enable the meaneſt (if willing) to diſcover truth from falſhood.</p>
            <p>That which others have done, we deſire to bleſſe God for it. And if that which I have now done ſhall be any thing ſerviceable, it hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the end of him who is not unwilling to ſpend and to be ſpent for the Iſrael of God: that being the end for which we are what we are.</p>
            <p>Your ſelves are now upon the Stage, be cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious, fight the good ſight of Faith.</p>
            <p>And I aſſure my ſelf and you, that our victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhall be glorious, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, to whom be glory for ever. Amen.</p>

               <salute>Reverend Doctor,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Much marvell that you ſhould ſo much alter the ſtate of the Queſtions propounded to be debated.</p>
            <p>As you have laid them down I aſſure you I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them not.</p>
            <p>The language is too intricate for one that deſires to deale plainely, and onely ſtands up for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Gods truth, according to the grace that is given.</p>
            <p>Though your greater light hath diſcover'd it to be the doctrine of hell, as you have been pleaſed to call it.</p>
            <p>Our doctrines are plaine, and we deſire in the ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of our hearts the glory of God and the good of ſouls, without carrying on of any intereſt that your do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine relates to. We are not ignorant from whence it comes, and who they have been that have endeavoured to carry it on in this nation. I ſhall ſay no more but with <hi>Gamaliel, ſi ſit à Deo, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that you ſhall ſee our plaineneſſe, leſt peradventure you did not take a copy of what you wrote, I have tranſcribed it word for word.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:168495:5"/>
            <p>That which I ſhould affirmatively maintaine you ſay you conceive is this,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That Sin muſt of neceſsity have a being in the Saints while they live in the mortall body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doctor, the words were theſe, to be witneſſed by the Auditors; and this God aſſiſting I will maintaine: <hi>That Sinne will have a being in the beſt of men, ſo long as their ſoules have a being in theſe houſes of clay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then the ſecond which I ſhould negatively main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, you ſay you conceive is this, <hi>That the righteouſneſſe of the Law conſiſting in the love of God above all, and of our Neighbour as of our ſelves, cannot in this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall life be fulfilled in the Saints by the graee of Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir, I have a long time ſince been acquainted with Mults, and <hi>Jus,</hi> and Saints, and ſuch like words.</p>
            <p>My words were as plaine as my meaning, and this God aſſiſting I will ſtand to maintain.</p>
            <p>Negatively I deny that any man by grace can in this life perform ſuch perfect obedience to the law of God, as not to offend againſt the ſame.</p>
            <p>It was your owne language, <hi>Or to be thereby juſtified otherwiſe then in and through Chriſt of grace given.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doctor, many at the meeting will affirme this to be my language. And this I have taught as the truth of God, and I hope if I ſhall be thereunto called, ſhall be enabled to ſeale it with my blood.</p>
            <p>Doctor, give me leave, as a Brother, though unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, to give you this Chriſtian Animadverſion, Call to mind whoſe doctrine it is which you ſtand up for, and who they have been that have ſtill done the ſame, <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius,
<pb facs="tcp:168495:6"/>Bellarmine,</hi> &amp;c. I doubt not of your acquaintance with the many more.</p>
            <p>But how cleerly this is againſt the Fathers of our Church, and ſome of their owne Doctors, I know you cannot be ignorant, as <hi>Augustine, Gregory, Lactantius, Ierome, Bernard, Anſelme,</hi> and all Moderne Divines, except <hi>Bellarmines</hi> Fraternity.</p>
            <p>I am ſorry that Doctor <hi>Drayton</hi> ſhould be contrary minded: but they and we are all men.</p>
            <p>I ſhall pray to God to diſcover our Errors, and that in the end God may have glory, his Church reap bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, and Chriſtian brotherly love may be increaſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Doctor <hi>Drayton,</hi> and his unworthy fellow labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer in the Lords Vineyard,</p>

            <p>You ſay your doctrines are plaine, and that you deſire in the ſincerity of your heart the glory of God and the good of ſouls, neither of which can conſiſt with the continuance of ſinne in our mortall bodies: nor doe I carry on any intereſt, but what directly tends to the deſigne which you pretend to ayme at.</p>
            <p>You further ſay you are not ignorant from whence our doctrines come, but to that I crave leave to queſtion; for I am ſure it came from heaven, if the Prophets and Apoſtles had theirs to come from thence. Nor who they are who have endeavoured to carry it on in this nation, who doubtleſſe were the beſt men that ever were in this or any other nation, But I will with you take up <hi>Gamaliels</hi> counſell and concluſion, <hi>ſi ſit à Deo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Good Sir, forbeare the aſperſions of the truth, with the obloquies that have been caſt upon any that have held it forth.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:168495:7"/>
            <p>For the firſt Queſtion, I ſee no difference betwixt your firſt ſtating of it which I ſent unto you in your own words and your laſt. I ſhall therefore admit it in theſe new expreſſions, <hi>That ſinne will have a being in the beſt of men ſo long as their ſouls have a being in theſe houſes of Clay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the ſecond, I expreſſed my ſelfe again and again in the words which I ſent unto you, as all impartiall and underſtanding Auditors will atteſt. But I will take it in your owne words ſo far as they are plaine, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That you deny that any man by grace can in this life performe ſuch perfect obedience to the Law of God, as not to offend againſt the ſame.</p>
            <p>I mentioned nothing concerning the work of Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, nor ſhall that come into diſpute, unleſſe by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary conſequence.</p>
            <p>I thank you for your good adviſe, I ſhall next after Scriptures, avouch no other Authors but the Fathers of the Church, and perhaps ſome of our owne Modern Divines of the beſt note, and concluding with a note of your own prayer, reſt,</p>

            <p>NOw to the end that the er ſuing Diſcourſe may be proper and profitable for the informing the judgments of the weak, and for the eſtabliſhing them in the faith of the truth, which (next to the glory of God, and the advancement of his truth) is the onely thing intended: I ſhall obſerve this method. Firſt, I ſhall define what Sin in generall is. Secondly, what the firſt ſin wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>. Thirdly, the cauſes of the firſt ſinne. Fourthly, the effects thereof. And laſtly, what Originall Sin is. And ſo I ſhall proceed to confirmation of the firſt poſition.</p>
            <p>And firſt of the firſt, what Sin in generall is.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The word in Hebrew which is tra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ted <hi>ſinne,</hi> ſignifi th pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly <hi>miſdoing,</hi> or miſſing of the mark or way, as in <hi>Judg.</hi> 20.6. it is ſaid that the men of <hi>Benjamin</hi> could ſling a ſtone at an nares
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:168495:9"/>breadth and not ſin, that is, not miſſe. And in <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.2. it is ſaid, that <hi>he that is haſty with his foot, ſinneth,</hi> that is, miſſeth or ſwerveth.</p>
            <p>In Religion Gods Law is our mark or way, from which when we ſwerve, we ſin, and therefore Sin is defined to be the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the Law, as in 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.4. or whatſoever is repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the Law, that is a defect, or inclination, or action re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the Law of God. Which is the generall nature of ſinne.</p>
            <p>Or defect is this generall nature, and inclinations or actions, or rather the matter of ſin.</p>
            <p>The difference and formall eſſence of ſin is, as I ſaid, a repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy with the Law.</p>
            <p>The property which eleaveth faſt unto it is the guilt of the creature offending (that is to ſay) the binding of the creature to temporall and eternall puniſhments, which is done according to the order of Gods Juſtice.</p>
            <p>And hence it is that we commonly ſay there is a double for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality, or two-fold nature of ſin.</p>
            <p>Repugnancy with the Law, and guilt.</p>
            <p>Or that there are two reſpects, of which the former is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon or diſſimilitude with the Law, the other an ordaining to puniſhment.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place, the fall or firſt ſin of man was the diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of our firſt Parents <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> in Paradiſe, or the eating of the apple and ſruit forbidden, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.16, 17.</p>
            <p>This Commandment of God, Man through the perſwaſion of the Devil tranſgreſſed, and hence is our corruption and miſery derived.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the firſt ſin of man ſprang not from God, but from the inſtigation of the Devill, and from the free will of man.</p>
            <p>For the Devill provoked Man to fall away from God, &amp; Man yeelding to the enticeing allurements of the Devil freely revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from God, and wilfully forſook him.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the effects of mans firſt ſin are, firſt, guiltineſſe of death, and privation of Gods image in our firſt Parents.</p>
            <p>Secondly, originall ſin in us their poſterity, (that is to ſay) the guilt of eternall death, and the corruption and averſneſſe of our whole nature from God.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:168495:9"/>
            <p>Thirdly, actuall ſinnes which are ſprung of originall, for <hi>quod eſt cauſa cauſae, eſt cauſa cauſati:</hi> That which is the cauſe of the cauſe, is alſo the cauſe of the effact.</p>
            <p>But the firſt finne in man is the cauſe of his originall, and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, ſinne is the cauſe of his actuall ſinne.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, all the evills of puniſhment are inflected for ſinnes, Therefore the firſt ſinne of man is the cauſe of all other his ſinnes and puniſhments.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, originall ſinne is a want of originall righteouſneſſe which ſhould be in us, for originall righteouſneſſe was not only a conformity of our nature with the law of God, but alſo it comprehendeth in it Gods acceptation and approbation of this righteouſneſſe.</p>
            <p>Now by the fall of man, inſtead of conformity, there ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in mans nature deformity and corruption, and guiltineſſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of approbation.</p>
            <p>And thus much briefly by way of explication, what ſinne in generall is. The generall nature of ſinne, the difference or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall eſſence of ſinne, and the property which cleaveth faſt unto it.</p>
            <p>What the firſt ſinne was, the cauſes of it, the effects of it, and what originall ſinne is.</p>
            <p>Come we now to prove the poſition, <hi>That this ſinne,</hi> originall ſinne, <hi>will have a being in the beſt of men ſo long as their ſouls have a being in theſe houſes of clay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus we prove it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that the ſpirit by the law intitleth us to <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, as a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivation from the root to the branches, as poyſon is carried from the fountaine to the Ciſterne, and as the children of traytors have their blood tainted with their fathers treaſon, and the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of bondſlaves are under their parents condition, <hi>John</hi> 3.5, 6. <hi>That which is born of the fleſh is fleſh, &amp;c.</hi> Rom. 5.12, 16, 17, 18, 19. <hi>Wherefore as by one man ſinne entred into the world, and death by ſinne: and ſo death paſſed upon all men for that all bad ſinned, and not as by one that ſinned, ſo is the gift: for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offences unto juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. For if by one mans offence, death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteouſneſs
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:168495:10"/>ſhall reigne in life by one, Jeſus Chriſt. Therefore as by the offence of one judgement came upon all men to condemnation: even ſo by the righteouſneſſe of one the free gift came upon all men unto juſtification of life. For as by one mans diſobedience many were made finners: ſo by the obedience of one, ſhall many be made righteous,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 37, 48, 49. <hi>The firſt man is of the Earth earthy,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>By nature we are the children of wrath,</hi> 2 Epheſ. 3.14. Job. 4. <hi>Who can bring a cleane thing out of an unclcane,</hi> 51 Pſal. 5. <hi>In ſin was I conceived &amp;c. I called thee a tranſgreſſour from the womb,</hi> Iſa. 48.8. G. p. 8. 21. <hi>The imaginations of a mans heart are evill from his youth. We were all one in Adam, In uno univerſi,</hi> and with him ſaith S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In him legally, in regard of the ſtipulation and covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and him. We were in him paries in that covenant, had intereſt in the mercy, and were liable to the curſe which belonged to the breach of the covenant; and in him naturally, and therefore unavoidably ſubject to all that bondage and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then which the humane nature contracted in his fall. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with agree moſt of the Fathers.</p>
            <p>Adde we hereunto theſe two Arguments.</p>
            <p>Firſt, every thing which is borne carrieth with it the nature of that which bare it, as touching the ſubſtance and the accidents proper to the ſpeciall kind.</p>
            <p>But we are all born of corrupted and guilty parents. We therefore all draw by nature in our birth their corruption and guilt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, by the death of Chriſt who is the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> we receive a double grace, juſtification and regeneration.</p>
            <p>Therefore it followeth, that out of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> there iſſued and flowed a double evill (I meane the guilt and corruption of our nature) otherwiſe we had not ſtood in need of a double grace and remedy.</p>
            <p>This then is the firſt charge of the Spirit upon us, Participation with <hi>Adam</hi> in his ſin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adams</hi> perſon being the fountaine of ours, and <hi>Adams</hi> will the repreſentative of ours.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In this ſin there is univerſall corruption which hath in it two great evills.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:168495:10"/>
            <p>Firſt, a generall defect of all righteouſneſſe and holineſſe in which we were at firſt created.</p>
            <p>And Secondly, an inherent deordination, evill diſpoſition, diſeaſe, propenſion to all miſchief, antipathy and averſation from all good, which the Scripture calls <hi>the fleſh, The wiſdome of the fleſh, the body of ſin, Earthly members, the law of the members, the works of the devill, the lusts of the devill, the hell that ſets the whole courſe of nature on fire,</hi> John 3.6. Rom. 8.6.7. James 3.15. Epheſ. 4.22. Col. 3.5. Rom. 7.23. 1 John 38.</p>
            <p>And this is an evill, of the through malignity whereof no man can be more ſenſible and diſtinctly convinced (as in the evidence of that conviction to cry out againſt it with ſuch ſtrange and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter complaint) then <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24. <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Untill his underſtanding was opened to conceive the ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, penetration and compaſſe of that holy law which mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſureth the very bottome of every action, and condemneth as well the originalls as the acts of ſin, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.25. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.14. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12. <hi>Pſal</hi> 119.96. <hi>Luke</hi> 10.27.</p>
            <p>But for more cleare ſatisfaction, let us conſider the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality of this ſin: Firſt, the univerſality of times from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moſes</hi> even when the law of Creation was much defaced, and they that ſinned did not ſin after the ſimilitude of <hi>Adam</hi> againſt the cleare Revelation of Gods holy will, for ſo I take the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Apoſtle in theſe words, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.13, 14, 20, 21. For untill the law ſin was in the world: but ſin is not imputed when there is no law. Nevertheleſſe death reigned from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> even over them that had not ſinned after the ſimilitude of <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion, who is the figure of him that was to come, further ſee 20. and 21.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntill the law ſin was in the world, but ſin is not imputed where there is no law,</hi> verſe 13.</p>
            <p>Though the law ſeemed quite extinct between <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> by the wicked of the world, and with it ſin, becauſe ſin hath no ſtrength where there is no law.</p>
            <p>Though men had not any ſuch legible characters of Gods will in their nature as <hi>Adam</hi> had at firſt, And therefore did not ſin after the ſimilitude of his prevarication.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:168495:11"/>
            <p>Yet even from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moſes</hi> did ſinne reigne over all them, even that ſinne of <hi>Adam,</hi> and that luſt which that ſinne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted.</p>
            <p>Secondly, there is univerſality of men, and in men univerſality of parts.</p>
            <p>All men, and every part of man ſhut up under the guilt and power of this ſinne.</p>
            <p>And both theſe the Apoſtle notes at large, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.9. <hi>&amp;</hi> 19.23.</p>
            <p>What then are we better then they? no in no wiſe; for we have before proved, both Jewes and Gentiles, that they are all under ſinne.</p>
            <p>Now we know, that what things ſoever the law ſaith, it ſaith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be ſtopped, and all the world may become guilty before God, for all have ſinned, and come ſhort of the glory of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.32. for God hath concluded them all in unbeliefe, that he might have mercy upon all. So alſo <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.21.22. If there had been a law given that could have given life, verily righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſhould have been by the law, but the Scripture hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded all under ſin, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This ſhewes the univerſality of perſons in the 3. to the Rom. 13.14.15.16.17. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle addes, their throat is an open ſepulcher, with their tongues they have uſed deceit, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And the 6. <hi>Gen.</hi> 5. and the 8. and the 21. <hi>The imaginations of the heart are evill continually.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe particulars are enough to make up an induction, and to inferre an univerſality of parts.</p>
            <p>That from the underſtanding, as it were the Crown of the head to the affections, as it were the ſole of the foot, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but loathſomneſſe.</p>
            <p>A lively deſcription, whereof you may read in the 16. of <hi>Ezehiel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the underſtanding there is a ſea of ignorance, uncapable of good things, but wiſe and witty in wickedneſſ.</p>
            <p>The conſcience full of blind feares and terrors, or elſe ſeared and ſenſeleſſe,</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:168495:11"/>
            <p>The memory ſlippery to retaine good impreſſions, but of a marble firmneſſe to hold faſt that which is evill.</p>
            <p>The will pliable and obſequious to the devill in his hands as wax, but as ſtiffe and hard as clay in Gods. All our affections are inverted, we love what we ſhould hate, and hate what we ſhould love; we are bold where we ſhould feare, and feare where we ſhould be bold; we remember what we ſhould forget, and forget what we ſhould remember: And ſo of all the reſt &amp;c. Thus the whole frame of mans heart is evill continually. The rout and rabble of impure and impious thoughts and deſires are not to be expreſſed.</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee how univerſall a corruption originall ſinne is. Therefore in ſcripture the whole man is called fleſh. Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in carnall works we work <hi>ſecundum hominem,</hi> when we are carnall we walk as men, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3. As our Saviour ſaith of the devill, <hi>John</hi> 8.44. when he ſpeaks a lye, he ſpeaks <hi>de ſuo,</hi> of his own, that is according to his own nature, So when men walk af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fleſh, they work of their own, they walk according to themſelves.</p>
            <p>For of our ſelves we can doe nothing, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, but only ſinne, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. when we doe any good it is by the grace of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10. But by the grace of God I am what I am; and his grace which was beſtowed upon me was not in vaine; but I laboured more abundantly then they all; yer not I, but the grace of God which was with me.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Animamque invulnere ponit,</hi> never ceaſeth to infeſt us till it ceaſe to be in us:</p>

            <p>Which Saint <hi>John</hi> further unfolds, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.20. God is greater than our hearts, and knoweth all things.</p>
            <p>Which places although moſt dangerouſly perverted by theſe innovators with whom we have to deale, doe yet in the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the holieſt men that are or have been evince this truth,</p>
            <p>That the luſts of the fleſh will be in us, and work in us ſo long as we carry our mortall bodies about us.</p>
            <p>Againe Secondly, this truth will appeare more fully if we conſider the four-fold condition of mans freedome of will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his four-fold ſtate and condition.</p>
            <pb n="19" facs="tcp:168495:13"/>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>in ſtatu confectionis.</hi> In the ſtate of innocency as he was Created. The will was free to good and evill, or freely to chuſe good, but ſo that it had ability of chuſing evill.</p>
            <p>So that it might perſiſt in good, God preſerving it; and might alſo fall into evill, God forſaking it.</p>
            <p>The former is proved from the perfection of the image of God in which man was created, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.27.</p>
            <p>The latter is too evident by the event of the thing it ſelfe, and by the teſtimony of Scripture.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.29. <hi>God made man upright, but man found out many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions.</hi> And the Apoſtle ſaith, Rom. 11 32. <hi>God hath ſhut up all men in unbeliefe, that he might have mercy upon all.</hi> Where the Apoſtle teſtifieth, that God of ſpeciall Wiſdome did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the firſt man againſt the fall.</p>
            <p>Neither did he allot him ſuch a portion of ability, that he might not be ſeduced by the devill and moved to ſio.</p>
            <p>But that he therefore permitted him to be ſeduced, and fall into ſin and death, That as many as were ſaved out of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ruine might be ſaved by his mercy alone.</p>
            <p>This fall was not <hi>praeter voluntatem Domini,</hi> That were to make a lame providence; <hi>nec contra,</hi> for that were to make a weak omnipotence; but <hi>juxta voluntatem Domini.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As nothing is done without the Everlaſting and moſt good counſell of God, ſo neither can this fall be exempted from it; though not as it was a ſin to the ruine of the Creature, but as a way to exerciſe the Juſtice and Mercy of the Creator:</p>
            <p>His juſtice in puniſhing, and his mercy in ſaving.</p>
            <p>If in the world there had been no miſery, there had been no mercy, no need of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>If no ſin, no matter for his juſtice to ſhew its ſelf.</p>
            <p>And yet herein the crime and fault of ſin neither can nor ought to be laid on God, but on mans will only, falling from the rule of his Creator, albeit notwithſtanding he fell from it by the eternall counſell of God.</p>
            <p>God and man both willing the ſame matter, but not after the ſame manner, or to the ſame end.</p>
            <p>God neither willing it with mans intent, nor man with Gods
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:168495:14"/>intent. <hi>Adams</hi> purpoſe being to be like God, Gods purpoſe being to manifeſt his own glory.</p>
            <p>It being neceſſary in reſpect of Gods decree, but voluntary in reſpect of <hi>Adams</hi> will.</p>
            <p>The purpoſe of the Creator did not take away the Creatures freedome; for ſin being no poſitive being, hath not an efficient cauſe but a deficient cauſe, (that is) the will of the Creature ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in obedience.</p>
            <p>So that notwithſtanding, God did hate the ſin, and therefore did neither abſolutely will it nor cauſe it, yet he juſtly ſuffered it to be done.</p>
            <p>I ſay juſtly, for whatſoever God doth is good and juſt, and not diſagreeing from his nature and law, whether the reaſon thereof be known or unknown unto us.</p>
            <p>I ſay ſuffered it to be done, for the Creator was not bound unto his Creature to preſerve him in his goodneſſe, neither doth the deniall of ſuch grace diſagree with the mercy and bounty of God, God having willed this, to be an occaſion of beſtowing a greater grace and benefit, as it is apparent in the fall and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring of man againe.</p>
            <p>For although it be mercy, not to rejoyce in the ruine or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Creature, yet mercy ought not to fight with juſtice.</p>
            <p>It is moſt juſt that more regard ſhould be had of the chief good, which is God, both by himſelf and by others, then of all Creatures.</p>
            <p>Wherefore very well doe agree together in God his mercy and his juſtice.</p>
            <p>His mercy which will not the death of a ſinner, and his juſtice which ſuffereth man-kind to fall, that thereby the goodneſſe and ſeverity of God may appeare.</p>
            <p>So that briefly, <hi>in ſtatu confectionis Adamus acceperit poſſe ſi vellet,</hi> he received a power to be if he would, <hi>ſed non habuit velle quod poſſet,</hi> but he had not power given him to will that he might be.</p>
            <p>Which firſt power having willingly caſt away, man now can challenge no more but what God will give, for God owes no Creature any thing.</p>
            <pb n="21" facs="tcp:168495:14"/>
            <p>If he gives it is of his free grace, if he withholds he doth no man wrong.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond ſtate in man fallen born of corrupt parents and yet not regenerate.</p>
            <p>Although man hath loſt that firſt grace of liberty to be if he will, yet the will doth work freely; but it is carried to evil only, and can doe nothing elſe but ſinne.</p>
            <p>And the reaſon is, becauſe the privation of the knowledge of God in the underſtanding, enſued on the fall, together with the want of inclination in the heart and will to obedience.</p>
            <p>Inſtead where of blindneſſe and averſeneſſe from God ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, the which man cannot ſhake off unleſſe he be rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate.</p>
            <p>Briefly, it is the fitneſſe and proneneſſe in man after his fall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unregenerate to chuſe only evill.</p>
            <p>Of this blindneſſe and corruption of mans nature after the fall, it is ſaid, <hi>All the thoughts of man are evill, &amp;c.</hi> Gen. 6.5. <hi>and can the Ethiopian change his skin?</hi> Jer. 13.23. <hi>And a corrupt tree cannot bring forth good fruit,</hi> Mat. 7.28. <hi>and dead in ſinnet, by nature the ſonnes of wrath,</hi> Epheſ. 2.1.3. <hi>and we are not able of our ſelves to think any thing as of our ſelves.</hi> 2 Cor. 3.5.</p>
            <p>With theſe teſtimonies concurreth every mans experience, and the weary conſcience which proclaimeth that we have no li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty or proneneſſe of will to doe that which is good, but too great freedome and readineſſe to practiſe evil, unleſſe we be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, as it is ſaid, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.18. <hi>Convert thou me, and I ſhall be converted, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore there is no love of God in us by nature, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we have by nature no readineſſe to obey God.</p>
            <p>From whence it comes to paſſe, that the enmity between God and man is not in God, but in man, who will not now rank himſelf in the roome of a ſubject, and yield to the Lord the place of a Commander.</p>
            <p>There is only now this queſtion between God and man.</p>
            <p>Whoſe will ſhould be done? The Lord craves that man ſhould ſubject his will to Gods will.</p>
            <p>But man aſpires to make his own will the rule of his actions, and in this miſerable ſtate lives every man not renewed by grace,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:168495:15"/>he ſets up within himſelf a will contrary to Gods moſt holy will.</p>
            <p>And this is the fruit of <hi>Adams</hi> apoſtaſy; for in his Creation he had a perfect conformity to the law or will of God, and had power to yield exact obedience to the ſame. But now onely a readineſſe to doe evill.</p>
            <p>But no power of it ſelfe to doe good.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, in the third ſtate. Take a man as he is renewed, we deny againſt all our adverſaries that our will is a co-worker with grace, by the force of nature; But we ſay it worketh by grace with grace:</p>
            <p>We deny that grace doth enable the will of it ſelf to doe good works if it pleaſe: But we ſay that grace worketh in the will to pleaſe, and to doe ſuch offices as God requires at our hands.</p>
            <p>God doth not hang his work upon the ſuſpended <hi>If</hi> of our will, but he worketh in us to will, and cauſeth us to doe the things that he commandeth to doe, as in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 36.27. <hi>I will put my ſpirit within you, and cauſe you to walk in my Statutes, and ye ſhall keep my judgments and doe them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We will indeed, ſaith <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> but God worketh in us to will; we work, but God worketh in us to work; we walk, but God worketh in us to walk; we keep his commandements, but God worketh in us to keep them, according to that in the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians</hi> 2.13. <hi>It is God that worketh in you both to will and to doe of his good pleaſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that in this eſtate the cauſe for which the will beginneth to work well is this.</p>
            <p>Becauſe by the ſingular grace or benefit of the holy Spirit, mans nature is renewed by the word of God, there is kindled in the mind a new light and knowledge of God, in the heart new affections, in the will new inclinations agreeing with the law of God.</p>
            <p>And the will effectually moved to doe according to theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, and ſo it recovereth both that power of willing that which God approveth, and the uſe of that power; and beginneth to be conformed and agreeable to God, and to obey him, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.6.</p>

            <p>And yet notwithſtanding we muſt know, firſt, in this life, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of our nature is not perfect, neither as concerning out knowledge of God, neither as concerning our inclination to obey God.</p>
            <p>And therefore in the beſt of men while they live here, doe remaine ſinnes both originall and others.</p>
            <p>And Secondly, that the regenerate be not alwayes ruled by the holy Spirit, but are ſometimes forſaken of God, God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing himſelf for a ſeaſon, either to try them, that is, to make their weakneſſe without God known to themſelves, as in <hi>Peter;</hi> or to chaſtiſe or humble them: but yet are recalled to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance that they periſh not.</p>
            <p>Of the firſt the Apoſte teſtifieth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.18. <hi>I know that in me, that is my fleſh, dwelleth no good thing:</hi> for to will <hi>is preſent with me, but I find no means ſo performe that</hi> which is good. And in <hi>Marke</hi> 9.24. <hi>Lord I believe, help my unbeliefe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of the ſecond it is ſaid, <hi>Take not thy holy ſpirit from me:</hi> and <hi>Eſay</hi> 63.17. It is ſaid. <hi>O Lord, why haſt thou made us to erre from thy wayes, and hardened our heart from thy feare? Return for thy ſervants ſake, the Tribes of thine inheritance.</hi> and in the 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.57.</p>
            <p>The Lord our God be with us as he was with our fathers, <hi>let him not leave us or forſake us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore the regenerate in this life doth alwayes goe either forward or backward, neither continueth in the ſame ſtate.</p>
            <p>Here then are deduced theſe two concluſions.</p>
            <p>Firſt, as man corrupted before he be regenerate can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not begin new obedience pleaſing and acceptable to GOD, ſo he that is regenerate in this life, although he begin to obey God (that is) hath ſome inclination and purpoſe to obey according to all his commandements, and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:168495:16"/>that unfeigned, though yet weak and ſtrugling with evill incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, affections, and deſires; and therefore there ſhine in his life and manners a deſire of piety towards God and his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, yet he cannot yeild whole and perfect obedience to God, becauſe neither his knowledge nor love to God is ſo great and ſincere as the law of God requireth.</p>
            <p>And therefore it is not ſuch righteouſneſſe as may ſtand before God, according to the Pſal. 143.2, <hi>Enter not into judgment with thy ſervant O Lord, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, they who are converted can no further retaine good inclinations, thoughts, affections, or purpoſes to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere and goe forward therein, then as the holy Spirit worketh and preſerveth theſe in them, for if he guide and rule them, they judge and doe aright, but if he withdraw, they are blind, and wander, and ſlip, and fall, yet ſo as they pariſh not, if ſo be they were ever truly converted, according to theſe places, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7. <hi>What haſt thou that thou haſt not received, &amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Philip.</hi> 4. and 2 <hi>Philip.</hi> 13. and <hi>John</hi> 15.5. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.8. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. and 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5.</p>
            <p>In the fourth eſtate after glorification, after the end and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation of this preſent life. In this liberty the wil ſhal only be free to chuſe good and not to chuſe evil and this ſhal be the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect liberty of our will, by which we ſhall not only not ſin, but ſhall abhorre nothing more than ſin, and alſo ſhall not be able to ſin any more.</p>
            <p>No place ſhall be for ignorance or for error, or any doubting of God, or for the leaſt ſtubbornneſſe againſt God.</p>
            <p>Becauſe in the mind ſhall ſhine perfect knowledge of God and his will.</p>
            <p>In the will and heart a moſt perfect and exceeding inclination to obey God, an exceeding love of God, a joy and reſting in God, and an agreeableneſſe and conformity with God, ſo much and in ſuch manner as ſuch Created veſſells are capable of.</p>
            <p>And this ſhall continue for all eternity, they ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually ruled by the holy Ghoſt in all their actions.</p>
            <p>So that it cannot poſſibly be, that any of their actions there, ſhould once ſwerve from righteouſneſſe, and therefore it is ſaid, <hi>they are as the Angels of God in heaven,</hi> Mat. 22.30.</p>
            <pb n="25" facs="tcp:168495:16"/>
            <p>The liberty of the will ſhall be truly conformed and perfected to chuſe only good, to obey and love God with unexpreſſible alacrity for ever.</p>
            <p>And thus having laid down the four-fold ſtate of man, and the four-fold liberty of will anſwerable to his four-fold ſtate, it may ſerve for one ground to confirme the point in hand, That ſinne will have a being in the beſt of men, ſo long as they are here.</p>
            <p>Their renewed ſtate upon earth being but begun not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, their ſtate being but a growing in grace, and profitting more and more, and prevailing in mortifying their corruptions, but not attaining in this mortall life to have grace conſummate, nor corruption aboliſhed, but ſin in part remaines and will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine till they lay down the body, and be compleatly ſanctified in the ſtate of glory.</p>
            <p>And for farther confirmation, I ſhall lay you downe the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of the Scripture, the Confeſſion of the Fathers, and ſome Reaſons grounded upon, and backed with the Word of God.</p>
            <p>Firſt, for Scriptures, ſee Rom. 8.1. <hi>There is no condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> &amp;c. In which words we may obſerve, the Apoſtle doth not ſay, that there is no ſinne to them that are in Chriſt, but he ſaith <hi>there is no condemnation to them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the fore-going Chapter he had confeſſed that he did the evill which he would not doe, and that he ſaw a law in his members rebelling againſt the law of his mind.</p>
            <p>But now he rejoyceth in Chriſt, that ſin in him is not able to condemn him.</p>
            <p>But here I expect from my friend either <hi>Cajetan</hi> or <hi>Aquinas</hi> falſe expoſition, or that of Mr. <hi>Parker,</hi> that the Apoſtle ſpake this when he was a Babe in grace.</p>
            <p>But I deſire withall that they will acquaint us what ſtate it was when the Apoſtle acknowledgeth himſelfe the <hi>chief. of finners,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15.</p>
            <p>The glorious Goſpel was then committed unto him, ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by Jeſus Chriſt, counted Faithfull, and put into the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:168495:17"/>as you may ſee in the fore-going verſes: And yet then ſaith he notwithſtanding all this, <hi>This is a true and faithfull ſaying,</hi> JESUS CHRIST <hi>came into the World to ſave ſinners Whereof I am chief,</hi> (Mark) the preſent-tenſe, not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terperfect-tenſe, he doth not ſay, whereof I have been, <hi>but whereof I am.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, I pray ſee the ſecond Epiſtle, 1. from 6. to the 13. was all this when he was a babe in grace? I would faine know how long it was between the time of writing theſe Epiſtles to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and his Epiſtle to <hi>Philemon.</hi> 1. for there verſe 9. he was then <hi>Paul the aged.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But theſe Jeſuiticall Cavillings and reaſonings are too well known. They never doe nor never ſhall prevaile againſt Gods truth.</p>
            <p>Againe, in the ſecond verſe, <hi>for the law of the Spirit of life which is in Chriſt Jeſus hath freed me from the Law of ſinne and death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here we may obſerve, that the Apoſtle ſaith not that we are fully freed from ſinne in this life, but from the law of ſinne.</p>
            <p>That is, both from the commanding and condemning power of ſinne.</p>
            <p>Sinne doth not now reigns in our mortall bodies, neither now hath it any more power, to detaine us under death.</p>
            <p>But as for temptations of ſin, Chriſtian experience teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that there is no ſort of men more troubled with them then they whom God hath begun to deliver from the law of ſinne.</p>
            <pb n="19" facs="tcp:168495:17"/>
            <p>For Sathan being impatient of his loſſe, ſeeks dayly to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his former dominion:</p>
            <p>By which it may appear, That,</p>
            <p>Our deliverance from ſin is but begun now, not perfected.</p>
            <p>But we know our God is faithfull, by whom we are called, he ſhall alſo confirm us to the end: <hi>Phil</hi> 1.6. even <hi>He who hath begun a good work in us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Bleſſed be the Lord, where before we were Captives of ſin, now the caſe of the Battell is altered, and changed:</p>
            <p>Sin is become our Captive, through Chriſt:</p>
            <p>It remains in us, not as a Commander, but as a Captive of the Lord Jeſus.</p>
            <p>The bolts of ſin are yet upon our hands and feet, to admoniſh us of our former miſerable condition.</p>
            <p>We draw the chains of our ſins after us, which makes us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed goe forward the more ſlowly.</p>
            <p>But they are not able to detein us in that bondage wherein we lay before.</p>
            <p>We are delivered from the law of ſin whileſt we live; and the nature of death the wages of ſin is ſo changed, That it is not the death of the man, but the death of ſin, in the man, <hi>mors eſt Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pultura vitiorum,</hi> ſaith <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> Death is the buriall of all vices, and, as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaith, <hi>As the Worm which is bred in tho Tree, doth at laſt conſume it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So death which is brought out by ſin, doth at laſt conſume and deſtroy ſin: in the Children of God, ſin will remain, though not raign.</p>
            <p>Again in the 13. <hi>verſe, If ye mortifie the deeds of the body;</hi> whereby the Apoſtle ſheweth, That after regeneration by Grace, and before glorification, Grace is not conſummated, nor is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption wholly aboliſhed.</p>
            <p>For although the Apoſtle affirmed before in the 9. <hi>verſe,</hi> that theſe godly Romans were not in the fleſh, yet now he exhorts to a further mortification of the luſts of the fleſh, which exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation were ſuperfluous, if there were no luſts in them that need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be mortified.</p>
            <p>Where we ſee cleerly that which we alſo feel in our ſelves, that ſo long as We live in the body, there is ever ſome rema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:168495:18"/>life of ſin, which we had need to mortifie and put out.</p>
            <p>Our life is therefore called a warfare, <hi>Bellum eſt non trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus,</hi> ſaith <hi>Auguſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in this battell we muſt fight without intermiſſion, till we have gotten the victory, for who can ſay, that he hath in ſuch ſort cut away his ſuperfluities, that there remains nothing in him, which hath need of reforming.</p>
            <p>When they are once quenched they kindle again.</p>
            <p>Whatſoever he be, unleſſe he diſſemble, he ſhall alwaies finde within himſelf, ſomething that hath need to be ſubdued.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Velis, nolis, infra fines tuos habitavit Jebuſeus,</hi> will thou, nill thou the Jebuſite ſhall dwell within thy border, <hi>ſubjugari poteſt, ex termina non poteſt,</hi> he may be ſubdued but cannot be rooted out ſaith holy <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> it is impoſſble for a man to lead a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian life, without a continuall battell.</p>
            <p>Again in the 17. of <hi>Jeremy</hi> 9. <hi>verſe, The heart of man is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull above all things, and evill continually, who can know it?</hi> which is not only ſpoken of a wicked mans heart.</p>
            <p>But the deceiptfulneſſe is attributed to all men indifferently.</p>
            <p>Chriſt only excepted, <hi>in whoſe mouth,</hi> or heart, <hi>there was no guile.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By nature all our hearts are alike.</p>
            <p>Procreation is an naturall act, though propagation be not from the inſtrument, but from the author, <hi>Adam</hi> begat a ſonne in his likeneſſe: men beget children as they are men, not as they are regenerate and holy men.</p>
            <p>Nature with its corruption is derived, but not Grace, for that is ſupernaturall.</p>
            <p>And the change that Grace makes in this life, is not ſuch, but that in ſome ſort the hearts of the beſt are deceitfull.</p>
            <p>Chriſt indeed gave <hi>Nathaniell</hi> that praiſe, that <hi>there was no guile in his heart;</hi> and <hi>David</hi> ſaith the like of every juſtified man, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 32.2.</p>
            <p>But this is true only of the Spirit of the new or young man, that is created by God in the regenerate.</p>
            <p>And not of that fleſh, that old man, that by reaſon of his age is often too hard for the young man.</p>
            <p>Though the young man increaſing daily, at length gets
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:168495:18"/>the victory: So that thus the beſt expoſitors read this Text.</p>
            <p>The heart of man is deceitfull, even the whole heart of the wicked, becauſe it is wholly fleſh.</p>
            <p>And part of the heart of the godly, namely the unregenerate and fleſhly part: The heart of the wicked is deceitfull, with a full, ſtrong, and raigning deceitfullneſſe.</p>
            <p>But the deceitfulneſſe that is in the heart of the godly, is weaker, as being diſcerned of them, and ſtroven againſt by them.</p>
            <p>The heart of the wicked, ſhews its deceitfulneſſe in the whole courſe of their lives.</p>
            <p>The godly only in ſome particular actions; as it is ſaid of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> his heart was upright in all things, ſave only in the matter of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah:</hi> the generall currant of his life was farre from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulneſſe, though not the particular action.</p>
            <p>Naturally, the heart of the wicked may be upright in ſome particular actions, as <hi>Abimilech</hi> in taking of <hi>Sarah, Gen.</hi> 20.6. <hi>I know ſaith God, thou hast done this in the uprightneſſe of thy heart;</hi> yet not in the main of their lives.</p>
            <p>For every regenerate man, is partly fleſh, and partly ſpirit, whereupon ariſeth that war in their hearts; like the ſtrugling of the two children in <hi>Rebeckahs</hi> wombe; and that continuall wreſtling between the fleſh and the ſpirit; ſo that their ſinnes are but paſſing away not paſſed already.</p>
            <p>And their newneſſe of life is but renewing, and not wholly renewed, becauſe they are like the ayre at the dawning of the day, wherein darkneſſe and light are mixed together.</p>
            <p>And though the regenerate may be like a cup of Wine mingled with water, that is, not half water and half Wine, but wholly Wine, and wholly water:</p>
            <p>Even as a Veſſell filled with equall proportion of hot and cold water, is not half hot and half cold, but wholly luke warm, that is, partly hot and partly cold in all the parts of it.</p>
            <p>For the regenerate man is not half old, and half new, but old throughout, and new throughout.</p>
            <p>That is, partly holy, and partly unholy, in all the parts and powers both of his body and ſoul: although the denomination of a regenerate is alwaies given him in the Scriptures, <hi>a parte praestantiori,</hi> from his better and more noble part.</p>
            <pb n="22" facs="tcp:168495:19"/>
            <p>And therefore no Saint on earth is voyd of ſinne, his heart being deceitfull, as I have ſhewed you by Gods own teſtimony.</p>
            <p>Again, the Lord who made the heart, and ſearcheth all hearts, and to whom all the imaginations of the thoughts before they are, are only known, as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.2. pronounceth us all guilty of ſin, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.5.</p>
            <p>And ſhall we not give credence to Gods aſſertion?</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.3. every man is a lyer, and in the 9. and the 19. <hi>verrſe,</hi> the Apoſtle teſtifieth that <hi>both Jews and Gentiles are all under ſin,</hi> and according to the Pſalmiſt, <hi>there is none righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous no not one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And remarkable is that, the 59. <hi>Eſay,</hi> to this purpoſe, and in the <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.20. and <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.16. <hi>by the deeds of the Law ſhall no fleſh be juſtified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in the 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.46. <hi>there is no man that ſinneth not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, for <hi>Job</hi> 9.2. in the 20. <hi>verſe</hi> of the 8. <hi>chap. Bildad</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying Gods juſt dealings to <hi>Job,</hi> ſaith, <hi>that God will not caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way a perfect man,</hi> the which <hi>Job</hi> affirmeth and acknowledgeth in the 2. of the 9. <hi>chap. I know,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>it is of a truth, but how ſhould man be juſt with God:</hi> mark in 30. and 31. <hi>verſ. If I waſh my ſelf with ſnow water, and make my hands never ſo clean, yet ſhalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and my own cloths ſhall make me to be abhorred.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 130.3. <hi>If thou Lord ſhouldeſt mark what is amiſſe, who might ſtand, &amp;c</hi> and in 143. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. <hi>enter not into Judgement with thy Servant, for in thy ſight ſhall no man living be juſtified:</hi> that is, <hi>by his own righteouſneſſe which is but as filthy rags, Eſay</hi> 64.6.</p>
            <p>No man living, ſaving <hi>He whom God hath made to be ſinne for us, who know no ſinne, that we might be made the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of God by him,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. Mark, he doth not ſay actively, that we ſhould make or work our own righteouſneſſe, but poſitively, <hi>that we ſhould be made the righteouſneſſe of God,</hi> and that not by by our ſelves, leaſt we ſhould glory in our ſelves, but by another, <hi>even Jeſus Chriſt the righteous, bleſſed for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, <hi>Job</hi> 14.4. <hi>who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one:</hi> and in <hi>Pro.</hi> 20.9. <hi>Who can ſay I have made my heart
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:168495:19"/>clean, I am pure from my ſinne? Rom.</hi> 8, 7. <hi>Pro.</hi> 24.16. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.3.</p>
            <p>If my friends could produce but one ſuch man, and prove it, I would yeeld the Buckler: No, <hi>Caietan</hi> one of their own fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity ſaith, that <hi>damnatum est peccatum, non extinctum,</hi> ſinne is condemned, but not extinguiſhed, <hi>for in many things we offend all, James</hi> 3.2.</p>
            <p>Again, hereunto beſides many, theſe and many more teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Scripture, that might be alledged, the ſuffrages of pure Antiquity in a ſweet harmony doth agree.</p>
            <p>I will quote ſome few of the Fathers; it was the preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of Chriſt alone to know no ſinne, and to be found <hi>ſolus in hominibus, qualis quaerebatur in peccoribus,</hi> alone ſuch amongſt men, as was ſought amongſt the beaſts, an immaculate Lambe without ſpot, and <hi>all we, like ſheep have gone aſtray, Eſay</hi> 53.6. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.22. <hi>optat. l.</hi> 2. <hi>Aug. cont. Relag. l.</hi> 2. <hi>C.</hi> 32. ſo <hi>Gregory. l.</hi> 3. <hi>in. Reg.</hi> 6. ſaith, <hi>There is no man which hath not in him ſome corruption, which he may and ſhould lament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So <hi>Lactantius cont. Gent. l.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 13. <hi>No man can be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſinne, ſo long as he is burthened with the garment of the fleſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So <hi>Hierom. cont. Jovin. li.</hi> 2. <hi>No man is clean from ſinne though he live but one day on earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So <hi>Bernard in Cant. Serm.</hi> 23 <hi>non peccare, Dei juſtitia eſt,</hi> not to ſinne is the juſtice and property of God: but the remiſſion of ſinnes is the juſtice of man.</p>
            <p>And therefore as the Ivy will not dye untill the Oake be hewn down; ſo our ſinne will not dye as long as we live, neither will it ever be aboliſhed untill death ends the conflict betwixt the fleſh and the ſpirit.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>Ambroſe de poenitent. li.</hi> 1. <hi>cap</hi> 6. <hi>It is not ſaith he, the voyce of thy family, I am whole and need not a Phyſitian, but heal me, O Lord, and I ſhall be healed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Alſo he ſpake thus to the <hi>Novatian Hereticks</hi> of his time, and it may fitly be turned, over to the Jeſuits of our time.</p>
            <p>Dareſt thou, O Jeſuit, call thy ſelf clean and holy? albeit thou wert clean in regard of thy work, this one word were enough to make thee unclean. With him agrees <hi>Aug. Serm.</hi> 29. <hi>de verb.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:168495:20"/>Apoſt. Sunt quidam inflati viri ſpiritu electionis pleni, non mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitudine ingentes, ſed ſuperbiae morbo tumentes, ut audeant dicere invenire homines abſque peccato.</hi> There are (ſaith he) ſome that be like unto Veſſels blown up with wind, filled with a haughty ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, not ſollidly great but ſwelled with the ſickneſs of pride: Who dare be bold to ſay that men are found on earth without ſinne?</p>
            <p>Of ſuch as theſe (ſaith he) I demand; What ſaieſt thou then that art juſt and holy this Prayer, <hi>Forgive us our ſinnes?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether is this a Prayer to be ſaid by Chatechiſts only, or to be ſaid of ſuch as are believers and converted Chriſtians?</p>
            <p>Surely it is the prayer of regenerate men, yea it is the prayer of the Sons of God; for they call God their Father in heaven.</p>
            <p>Where then are your juſt and holy ones, in whom are no ſins?</p>
            <p>If the Regenerate and Sons of God have need to crave remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſinnes, What are you who ſay you have no ſinne? <hi>Liars</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>John.</hi> 1.9.</p>
            <p>And our bleſſed Saviour, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.17. <hi>When you have done all, you can yet ſay, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But againſt this they have a ſilly ſubterfuge, albeit, ſay they, we were never ſo righteous, yet for humility ſake, we ſhould ſay we are unprofitable.</p>
            <p>I anſwer them as <hi>Aug.</hi> anſwered the ſame objection in his time, <hi>Propter humilitatem ergo mentiris,</hi> then, (ſaith he) for hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milities ſake thou lieſt: But it is certain Chriſt never taught man to lie for humility. This is but one of their old forged falſhoods.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>Bernard in Annunciat.

            </p>
            <p>Who better than the Prophet <hi>David</hi> of whom the Lord ſaid, <hi>I have found a man after mine own heart,</hi> and yet he had need to ſay, <hi>Enter not into judgement with thy ſervant. Bernard, in Cant. Ser.</hi> 23. ſaith, <hi>It ſufficeth me for all unrighteouſneſs to have him reconciled unto me, whom I have only offended.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To be without ſinne is the righteouſneſs of God: Mans righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs is Gods indulgence, pardoning his ſinne. We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:168495:20"/>therefore with him, <hi>In ſerm. contr. vitium. ingrat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wo to the miſerable Generation, to whom their own inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency ſeems ſufficient; for who is it that hath ſo much as aſpired to that perfection which the holy Scripture commands us?</p>
            <p>I grant that in ſome ſence godly men are called perfect in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture, in the 3 to the <hi>Phillip.</hi> about the 14. it is written, <hi>Let as many as are perfect be thus minded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He moves the queſtion, ſeeing he had ſaid immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that he was not perfect?</p>
            <p>How doth he now rank himſelf amongſt thoſe that are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect?</p>
            <p>How agrees theſe two, that he was perfect, and not perfect? <hi>Aug. in Ser.</hi> 38. anſwers he was perfect <hi>ſecundùm intentionem, non ſecundùm preventionem,</hi> perfect in regard of his intention and purpoſe, but not in regard of prevention and obteining his purpoſe. And hereunto agrees that of <hi>Bernard,</hi> in <hi>Cant. ſerm.</hi> 49. <hi>That great choſen Veſſel</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>grants perfection,</hi> that is, a going forward, but denies perfection; for <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he who hath come to the end, but he alſo is walking to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>towards it.</p>
            <p>We are ſo perfect in this life, that we are yet but walking to perfection.</p>
            <p>Therefore <hi>St. Ambroſe</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9. <hi>Apoſtolus aliquando quaſi perfectis loquitur, aliquando perfecturis, aliquando laudat, aliquando commonet,</hi> The Apoſtle ſpeaketh unto Chriſtians ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times as unto men that are perfect, other times, as unto men who are perfect in that which is required of them; that is, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſometimes he praiſes them for the good they have done, and otherwhiles he admoniſhes them of the good they have to doe.</p>
            <p>And as for that place, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.6. where it is ſaid, that Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charias <hi>and</hi> Elizab. <hi>walked in the Commandements of God without blame.</hi> The Jeſuits of <hi>Rhemes</hi> wreſt this to confirm their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, this making not for them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Auguſt.</hi> hath two reaſons whereby he proves out of the ſame Scripture, That <hi>Zacharie</hi> was not without ſinne.</p>
            <p>Firſt, becauſe he was a Prieſt, <hi>and was bound to offer, as well for his own ſinnes, as for the ſinnes of the people, Heb.</hi> 5.3.</p>
            <pb n="26" facs="tcp:168495:21"/>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>in that</hi> the Evangeliſt ſaith, <hi>he walked in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of God, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is an argument, he had not attained to the mark, for they that are at their journeys end ſit ſtill.</p>
            <p>To the which we may add a third, out of that ſame place the dumbneſſe inflicted upon him for his misbelieving, evidently proves, that he was not ſo perfect as to be without ſin.</p>
            <p>Beſides this, the Apoſtle conſtantly diſtinguiſhes betwixt <hi>pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catum &amp; crimen,</hi> betwixt ſinne and crime, that is, ſome grievous offence that gives ſlaunder and is worthy of crimination: We affirm ſaith <hi>Auguſt. That the life of holy men may be ſaid to be without crime, but not without ſin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And again he ſaith, <hi>Men live well, if they live without crime.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But he who thinks he can live without ſin, doth not thereby make himſelf free of ſin; but debars himſelf of the pardon of his ſinnes.</p>
            <p>There is a two fold perfection or righteouſneſſe, firſt, Imputed which is by way of relation, and doth perfectly juſtifie us befor God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Infuſed by way of inheſion, ſubjectively in us, and this is but inchoated and imperfect, and therefore cannot juſtifie us in the ſight of God.</p>
            <p>Or I ſay with <hi>Zanchius,</hi> that the perfection within the holy Scriptures, or writings of the ancient fathers, is aſcribed unto the Saints of God; for their righteouſneſſe and good works, is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Extrinſecall or Intrinſecall; Firſt, the Extrinſecall or adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious, is that perfection of condonation, when our imperfection is freely pardoned, for the death and paſſion of Jeſus Chriſt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that ſaying of <hi>Auguſt. All the Commandements of God, are reputed as done, when that is remitted, which is left undone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this righteouſneſſe conſiſteth rather in the remiſſions of ſinnes, than in the perfection of vertue.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Intrinſecall is that perfection of inheſion; and this is ſaid to be either abſolute or comparative.</p>
            <p>Firſt, it is ſaid to be abſolute when our hearts are ſincere and ſimple, free from hypocryſie and double dealing with God, ſo <hi>Job was a perfect man,</hi> and <hi>David was a man according to Gods own heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="27" facs="tcp:168495:21"/>
            <p>Becauſe his heart was ever ſeeking after God, and ſincere to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him; though through his infirmity he ſinned againſt him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Comparative in reſpect of others; ſo <hi>Noah</hi> is ſaid to be perfect, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.9. but obſerve, it was in <hi>generationibus ſuis,</hi> that is, in reſpect of all others that lived in thoſe Godleſſe daies.</p>
            <p>And ſo St. <hi>Paul</hi> meaneth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.7. We ſpeak wiſdome amongſt them that are perfect, that is, amongſt thoſe that have greater meaſure of knowledge and underſtanding than the reſt of men have.</p>
            <p>And for any other abſolute perfection, St. <hi>Paul</hi> is abſolutely againſt it, when he profeſſeth of himſelf that he had not attained unto it, as in the place before quoted, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>And ſaith <hi>Bernard, ſuper Cant. Serm.</hi> 50. <hi>Who dares arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate that to himſelf which St.</hi> Paul <hi>denyeth?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or I ſay that the intrinſecall perfection is two fold.</p>
            <p>Firſt, of Parts, Secondly of Degrees.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the former is when a man hath reſpect, as the Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſaith, unto all the commandements of God, and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not in his heart the breach of any of them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the latter is, when a man exactly performeth all that the Law in its full rigour requireth.</p>
            <p>And he that is perfect in the firſt ſenſe, may fitly be reſembled to a weak and feeble child, that hath <hi>omnes partes integrales,</hi> but not <hi>integraliter,</hi> all the integrall and perfect parts of a man, yet not integrally or perfectly.</p>
            <p>But he that is perfect in the ſecond ſenſe, is like a ſtrong and full grown man, that hath all his parts in their perfection.</p>
            <p>And we confeſſe, that the true ſervants of God in this life, may have the perfection of parts.</p>
            <p>Becauſe that in ſome meaſure, they may love every good, and hate every evill; though not continually as touching the exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of performance.</p>
            <p>Yet habitually as touching a conſtant reſolution.</p>
            <p>But that a man ſhould have the perfection of degrees, we ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deny becauſe that he can neither love the good, nor hate the evill as he ſhould doe.</p>
            <pb n="28" facs="tcp:168495:22"/>
            <p>And as for thoſe Teſtimonies of Scripture, that the Jeſuits, <hi>Bellarm. Becanus,</hi> and others doe wreſt againſt us, to prove the perfection of the Saints in this life: We anſwer with <hi>Auguſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, That ſome of thoſe places are exhortations ſhewing us what we ſhould doe, not proving what we can doe; for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions doe not ſhew <hi>ut tantum praeſtari poſſit quantum ſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>detur,</hi> that ſo much can be performed which is enjoyned, but they ſhew us <hi>quouſque conari oportet,</hi> how earneſtly we ſhould ſtrive to preſerve them, though we be not able perfectly to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That many of thoſe places doe ſhew us, not what we are now <hi>in via,</hi> in the way, but what we ſhall be hereafter <hi>in patria,</hi> at the end of our pilgrimage, when we ſhall be freed from the imperfection of our fleſh, and cloathed with the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of perfect righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That the Scripture in many places terms them <hi>perfect and immaculate</hi> which have defiled their Garments, or pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their Conſciences. Mark, not with no ſinnes, which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, with no groſs ſinnes, or damnable enormities, which, as I ſaid before, is commendable.</p>
            <p>When they faſhioned not themſelves unto the world, nor ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered ſin to reign in their mortall bodies.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The Scripture pronounceth men perfect, blameleſs, and bleſſed, not becauſe they have no ſinnes, but becauſe their ſinnes are not imputed unto them, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.1.</p>
            <p>And therefore though the Saints are called righteous and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, not only in regard of the imputative righteouſneſs and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Chriſt, but alſo in regard of that inherent righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which is wrought in them by the ſpirit of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Yet we muſt underſtand in what ſenſe they are thus inherently called righteous.</p>
            <p>For we muſt not think them to be ſo perfectly righteous, as to be void of ſin, or to be juſtified in the ſight of God.</p>
            <p>Becauſe, that together with the ſanctification of the Saints, there is ſtill in them a remainder of originall corruption, by the touch and ſtain whereof their beſt works are corrupted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed; and therefore we ſay, that although the Saints and holy men of God may, and have lived <hi>ſine ſcandalo,</hi> without offence,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:168495:22"/>and <hi>ſine querela,</hi> without reproof, or without complaint on mans part, by the obſervance of all outward precepts.</p>
            <p>Yet it is impoſible that the beſt of them ſhould live and die <hi>ſine peccato,</hi> without ſin 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.8.10. and that remarkable place in 4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. <hi>If Abraham had to glory, it was not before God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We grant that the Saints of God in this life may be called righteous or perfect in a four fold reſpect.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt Intentionally, becauſe they aim at, and deſire perfection; for reſting in a good condition is contrary to grace. <hi>(Grow in grace.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly Inchoatively, becauſe they begin and goe on more and more in the works of righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly Comparatively, becauſe that in reſpect of other mens unrighteouſneſs, they may very well be termed righteous.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly Acceptatively, becauſe God accepteth them, though not as abſolutely juſt in themſelves, by reaſon of their manifold ſinnes and defects; yet in Chriſt, and for Chriſt his ſake (through whom all their imperfections are pardoned) as juſt and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men.</p>
            <p>And thus you ſee how the Saints and true Servants of God may be called righteous and perfect: But ſtill we deny that they are therefore without ſin, or that they are thereby juſtified in the ſight of God.</p>
            <p>The beſt perfection of man in this life, is to finde and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge himſelf to be imperfect, as <hi>Auguſt.</hi> ſpeaketh.</p>
            <p>In the next place I ſhall lay you down ſome reaſons for the confirmation of this poſition, That ſin will have a being, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And then I ſhall anſwer ſome objections, and their wreſting of ſome Scriptures for the maintenance of their Error.</p>
            <p>And the firſt reaſon may be this, becauſe there is not any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Saints of God mentioned in Scripture, that the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of grace hath not charged with ſome ſinne; the moſt perfect in their generations were not without their failings, and that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their long walking with God; as <hi>Noah</hi> drunk, <hi>Lot</hi> inceſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; <hi>Abraham</hi> had ſome diffidence, when he conſented to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull means, in going into <hi>Hagar,</hi> for bringing about Gods purpoſe; <hi>Sarah</hi> lied and diſtruſted, when ſhe laughed at the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:168495:23"/>of a Sonne: <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> were barred out of <hi>Canaan</hi> for diſhonouring God by diffidence and paſsion: <hi>Hezekiah</hi> lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted up with pride: <hi>Job</hi> impatient, and humbled for it: <hi>David</hi> had foul ſinnes, and ſecret ſinnes, which he repented for, and prayed againſt: <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> and <hi>Aſa</hi> reproved: <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah</hi> and <hi>Zachariah</hi> puniſhed for ſinne, the one by untimely death, the other dumb.</p>
            <p>And yet theſe are reported in Scripture to have ſerved God with all their heart, with a perfect heart, and to have been faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
            <p>And therefore <hi>Auguſt.</hi> againſt the Pelagians, bids them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine all the Saints, and all will confeſs that whileſt they lived here they were not without ſinne.</p>
            <p>And again the perfection we have is ſuch, that we daily need to pray, <hi>forgive us our treſpaſſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any Saint on earth had to glory, it was with men, but not with God; for ſaith the Apoſtle in that <hi>Rom</hi> 4.2. <hi>If Abraham were juſtified by works, he hath whereof to glory, but not before God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, if this were the ſtate of the beſt men, how may it be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that it ſhould be otherwiſe?</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The beſt of men did ſtill ſtrive to grow in grace, and to be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; neither doe we read of any that did ſo ſtand, but that they fell into ſome ſinne, and had defects in their beſt performances. What needed elſe that prayer of godly <hi>Nehemiah</hi> 13.12. who, when he deſired that his good ſervice might be remembred with Gods reward, he alſo prayed it might be remembred with Gods forgiveneſs?</p>
            <p>So alſo we read that the high Prieſts offered for their own ſins, and did typically bear the ſins of the holy things, noting that our beſt workes want Chriſts attonement to make them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable.</p>
            <p>They came not from ſuch a pure principle of grace as doe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly fill the Soul, but ſome corruption remaining ſtayns them with ſome defects, there being in the principle of grace ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and the works flowing from it, ſome imperfection: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in this life it is not conſummate, as I have ſhewed, and ſhall further ſhew.</p>
            <pb n="31" facs="tcp:168495:23"/>
            <p>And therefore ſin dwelleth in us, and is not wholy aboliſhed. God reſerves the conſummation of grace for the ſtate of glory.</p>
            <p>Grace is glory begun, glory is grace conſummate: Glory inchoat here, grace perfected hereafter. <hi>The ſpirits of juſt men made perfect are in heaven, Heb</hi> 12.23.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> All our graces are imperfect in this life. To ſpeak of thoſe three divine Graces, <hi>Faith, Hope, Charity:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, Faith is not perfect in this life, becauſe Faith muſt be grounded upon knowledge; <hi>For how ſhall they believe in him whom they doe not know?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>That we know but in part,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12. <hi>and therefore we believe but in part:</hi> So that our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our may ſay of the beſt of us, as once to his Diſciples, <hi>O yee of little faith, Matt.</hi> 8.26.</p>
            <p>And the beſt of us may ſay unto him; with him whoſe child was poſſeſſed, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.24. <hi>Lord I believe; help my unbelief.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, Faith is not ſimply perfect in this life, becauſe that which is perfect admitteth no increaſe nor addition: But there is no man that liveth in this life which can ſay that he believeth ſo perfectly, as that he hath not need continually to pray, <hi>Lord increaſe our faith:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore there is no man can ſay his faith is perfect; and yet his faith ſhall be perfect hereafter.</p>
            <p>For it is abſurd to ſay there is no Faith in heaven, becauſe Faith is <hi>tam apparentium, quam non apparentium,</hi> as well of things ſeen, as of things not ſeen, according to our common ſaying I believe mine own eyes.</p>
            <p>Surely we muſt believe the continuance of that happineſſe which we have in heaven, and therefore there is a perfect Faith in heaven, becauſe it is grounded upon a certain knowledge.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Our hope in this life is imperfect; for although the Apoſtle compares it to an Anchor, yet that doth no wayes prove the perfection of Hope, but yeeldeth a great conſolation unto us, that although we ſhould feel our hope wavering and reeling ſometimes to and fro, yet it is ſure enough to ſtay us and preſerve us againſt all the windes and ſtormes of Sathan.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, Charity is not perfect in this life.</p>
            <pb n="32" facs="tcp:168495:24"/>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe, as I proved before, <hi>We know but in part, and therefore we can love but in part.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a Maxime amongſt Divines, that <hi>tantum ſcimus, quantum diligimus,</hi> imperfect knowledge cannot produce perfect charity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quod latet ignotum eſt, ignota nulla cupido,</hi> Ovid. Things unknown cannot be loved, and according to our knowledge and acquaintance with any one, ſo is our affection towards that one.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith <hi>We can neither deſire what we know not, nor enjoy what we love not:</hi> We love things according as we know them, and therefore ſeeing in heaven, we ſhall know God ſo perfectly, as ſuch Creatures are capable of knowing him, many degrees bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than we know him now:</p>
            <p>We ſhall in like manner love him far otherwiſe than we love him now.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, <hi>Perfect Charity expels fear,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.18. but there is no Saint on earth without feare, therefore no Saint here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with pefect Charity.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, Perfect Charity expelleth ſin, <hi>for love is the fulfilling of the Law,</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.10. And perfect love is the perfect ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of the Law, and where the Law is fulfil'd, there is no ſin committed, becauſe <hi>ſinne is the tranſgreſion of the Law, Gal.</hi> 5.14. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.4.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But in many things we offend all, James</hi> 3.2.</p>
            <p>And therefore there is no man indued with perfect Charity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Greater love can no man have,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>than to lay down his life for his friend,</hi> and yet this is not perfect; for they may doe it out of vain-glory, pride, and ambition, for a vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious reputation, as many have done for the ſafety of their Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>They may doe it for many other ſiniſter ends, yet this cannot prove a perfection of Charity.</p>
            <p>There cannot be a greater argument and ſigne; yet our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our doth not bring this to prove the perfection of our love.</p>
            <p>Which we cannot judge of, becauſe their ends, intentions, and many other circumſtances, which are requiſite for the perfection of any thing, are unknown.</p>
            <p>But to ſhew the greatneſſe of his love by the ſureſt argument,

            <p>And as for the teſtimony of St. <hi>John</hi> 15.14. that is, an hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall propoſition that can never prove the perfection of charity, becauſe we are never able to perform the condition.</p>
            <p>For although <hi>Bellarm.</hi> ſaith, <hi>We can keep Gods Word,</hi> that is, fulfill his Commandement; yet he proves it not.</p>
            <p>And for to ſay his Commandements are not grievous, and to ſay, that we can keep them, is not the ſame.</p>
            <p>For a thing may be very light, and yet heavier than I can bear; <hi>For the Commandements are juſt, and holy and good, Rom.</hi> 7.12. <hi>And the yoke of obedience is eaſie and light, Mat.</hi> 11.30. yet it is more than we can doe; and a great deale heavier than we can beare, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.14.</p>
            <p>And that not in regard of the heavineſſe of the things requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; but in reſpect of the weakneſſe of us that ſhould perform them.</p>
            <p>It muſt therefore follow where there is imperfection of Grace; there muſt needs be ſin, but in this life Grace is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate and perfect, <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, that which is the priviledge of the Saints in Heaven is not to be attained here on Earth; but to be exactly perfect, to be filled with God, to have no defect or imperfection remaining, is the priviledge of the Saints in Heaven.</p>
            <p>Therefore not the priviledge of the Church Militant.</p>
            <p>Here we pray, <hi>Enter not into Judgement with thy Servants.</hi>

            <p>Here we ſtill finde our need of Chriſt our Mediator, <hi>who is our Advocate with the Father,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.1, 2. What need of an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate if no ſinne? When ſhall he exerciſe his Office, if not for us in this life? &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Here we have cauſe to admire Gods Mercy, to bewaile our ſinnes, to goe forward, to riſe after falls, to be kept by the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty power of God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5.</p>
            <p>But in Heaven, ſinne and feare ſhall be gone, <hi>and all tears wiped away from our Eyes.</hi>

            <p>I hope what I have written may ſuffice for ſatisfaction, to them whoſe eyes the God of this World hath not blinded, that ſinne will have a being in the beſt of men, ſo long as our ſouls have a being in theſe houſes of clay.</p>
            <p>As to our adverſaries, I ſhall pray all that are faithfull to pray with me for them, that God would open their eyes that they may ſee their ſinne; and then I doubt not but that they will be aſhamed of their Doctrine.</p>
            <p>Conſidering out of what puddles they draw them, either from <hi>Pelagius,</hi> or <hi>Bellarmine, Bayly, Becanus,</hi> the Jeſuits, or from the Adamits, who are conceited that they are renewed to that pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which <hi>Adam</hi> had before the fall, <hi>Daneus</hi> on <hi>Aug. de hereſibus</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 31. or elſe from ſome of <hi>Romes</hi> fraternity, that are now crept in amongſt us, who are very well verſed in the old trade of Arch heritiques, falſifying truths to maintain lies.</p>
            <p>But I doubt not but God will diſcover them in due time, and in the intervall will keep them that are his, from being deluded by them.</p>
            <p>What? Men without ſinne?</p>
            <p>It was good hap for the <hi>woman that was taken in adultery, John</hi> 8. that her accuſers were none ſuch as theſe Preachers, for if they had been ſuch they would have obeyed our Saviour.</p>
            <p>And the woman had not ſcaped without a volley of ſtones, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her eares.</p>
            <p>And if it be true that they ſay, that a man may live and not ſinne; then that Article is in vain to believe the forgiveneſſe of ſinne: What need I believe the forgiveneſſe of ſinne, if I be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſinne?</p>
            <p>But to draw towards concluſion of this point; I ſhall ſay as the Eunuch anſwered <hi>Philip, Acts</hi> 8.30, 31. When he asked, <hi>

            <p>How can we walk in thy wayes, O Lord, without a guide?</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore commend this counſell, to all people that deſire to ſerve the Lord, and to walk in his wayes, as a point of good Religion.</p>

            <p>And from blinde Jeſuiticall Guides, with their falſe pretended new lights in a dark Lanthorn, their feigned lies, pretended Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations, but deluſions, Good Lord deliver us.</p>
            <p>Much good may their perfection on earth doe them.</p>
            <p>The Lord in mercy diſcover unto me my imperfections more and more, and humble me in the ſenſe of them ſo long as I live on earth, that I may alwayes with the poor Publican ſay <hi>Lord be mercifull unto me a ſinner:</hi> And that with St. <hi>Paul</hi> I may ſtill forget what is behinde, and ſtill preſs forwards towards the Marke, putting forth all the ſtrength that the Lord ſhall be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to lend me, and improve all opportunities that the Lord af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords me to the beſt advantage, for the mortifying of ſinne and ſinfull corruptions in me, and for the growing in grace untill I attain unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſſe of Chriſt, which ſhall be after grace conſummate in heaven hereafter.</p>
            <p>And for him that can finde perfection here on earth, let him never look for it in Heaven.</p>
            <p>Now in the laſt place I ſhall lay you down ſome of their argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt this truth, and ſome of the Scriptures that they wreſt to maintain their error.</p>
            <p>Firſt, They deny originall ſinne, and ſay it is taken away from the Saints of God on earth; and therefore they cannot derive it to their poſterity.</p>
            <p>Unto the antecedent we anſwer, that we muſt diſtinguiſh of ſinne. There are three things therein: the Offence, the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, the Pollution.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, Although God hates ſinne in his deareſt Saints, yet this to the regenerate man is aboliſhed and blotted out by the mercy of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, For the Obligation of the Sinner to puniſhment, this likewiſe is pardoned to ſuch a man through Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But as concerning the pure eſſence of ſin, the pollution there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that is, the vitious inclination or proneneſſe which that ſin
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:168495:26"/>leaves in us, to fall into it or the like, this remaineth in them.</p>
            <p>Although the power and ſtrength of this be taken away, that it cannot reign in a regenerate man, yet the life and being of ſinne is not quite taken away.</p>
            <p>And thus we ſay, <hi>God forgiveth all our iniquities, and healeth all our infirmities, Pſalme</hi> 103.3. <hi>quatenus</hi> as to the fault, guilt, and ſtrength; yet this is not done all at once, but gradually, by degrees, he begins this cure here, and goes on from day to day. But this renewing is not perfected in this life otherwiſe then as I have ſhewed you.</p>
            <p>Wherefore the godly doe derive ſuch a corrupt nature to their poſterity as they themſelves have.</p>
            <p>But they reply, That which Parents themſelves have not, they cannot derive to their poſterity.</p>
            <p>But the guilt of originall ſinne is taken away from regenerate Parents; therefore, at leaſt, the guilt is not derived.</p>
            <p>Unto this we anſwer, we muſt diſtinguiſh of the Major.</p>
            <p>The Parents indeed convey not to their poſterity that which by nature they have not.</p>
            <p>But they are freed from the guilt of ſinne, not by nature, but by grace and benefit of Chriſt; wherefore Parents derive unto their poſterity, not righteouſneſs which is freely imputed, but unrighteouſneſs, unto which themſelves by nature are ſubject.</p>
            <p>And the cauſe why they derive their guilt unto them, and not their righteouſneſs, is this.</p>
            <p>Becauſe their poſterity is not born of them according to grace but according to nature; Neither is grace and juſtification tyed to carnal propagation, but to the moſt free election of God, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, the death of Infants prove they have ſinne, becauſe God being moſt juſt, inflicts not this puniſhment but for ſin, <hi>ſtipendium peccati mors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Death went over all men, for as much as all men have ſinned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Although Infants doe neither good nor evill, nor offend not after the ſimilitude of <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion, yet they have ſinne in them, for which death reigneth over them.</p>
            <p>They want not the faculty of will, though in act they will not ſin, yet they will it by inclination, and corrupt inclinations
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:168495:26"/>are ſinnes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.7. <hi>I had not known luſt to be ſinne unleſſe the Law had ſaid, thou ſhalt not luſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus ſaith <hi>Ireneus</hi> and <hi>Chryſoſtome, Adams ſinne was no perſonal offence in uno univerſi.</hi> Adam ſtood at the root of all mankinde.</p>
            <p>His ſinne was his hand writing by which he made all his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity debtors unto God even for that ſinne, though themſelves ſhould have ſinned no more.</p>
            <p>Secondly, They ſay concupiſcence without conſenting to it is no ſinne; and to maintain this error, they bring <hi>Thomas A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinas,</hi> who ſaith, the firſt motion of the luſt of Adultery is not ſinne, becauſe it is an imperfect act; but if conſent be given to it, then it is a perfect act, and is ſinne.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Coſter,</hi> in his little <hi>Enchiridion,</hi> affirmeth, that concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence proceeds from ſin, and tendeth unto ſinne, but is not ſinne; and this he labours to expreſſe by this ſimilitude.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He that heares</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>another man ſpeaking filthy language and conſents not to it, but rather is angry at it, and reproves it, ſinneth not, but merits a greater reward;</hi> Even ſo when our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence ſends out any ſinfull motion, if we conſent not we ſinne not.</p>
            <p>And the Fathers of that Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> which have as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Curſes as Canons, have decreed in this manner.</p>
            <p>Concupiſcence, which ſometimes the Apoſtle called ſin, the holy Synod declares that the Catholique Church did never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it to be called ſinne, as it is truly and properly ſinne in the Regenerate;</p>
            <p>But becauſe it commeth from ſinne, and inclineth to ſinne.</p>
            <p>But for anſwer, We ſay that the Apoſtle, in 7. <hi>Rom.</hi> towards the latter end, condemneth concupiſcence for ſinne, even when conſent is not given unto it.</p>
            <p>For he proteſts of himſelf that he reſiſted theſe motions of ſin, but was oftentimes ſore againſt his will captivated by them:</p>
            <p>He condemnes them as evill, albeit he gave no conſent unto them; For the Law doth not only condemn ſinne in the branch, but alſo in the root.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There ſhall not be in thee any evil thought againſt the Lord thy God.</hi>

               </label> I will lay you down a reaſon to confirm this truth. Conſent in its own nature is a thing indifferent. If that whereunto I conſent be good, my conſent is good; but if it be evill, my conſent is evill.</p>
            <p>If the firſt motion of ſinne be not an evill in it ſelf, as they ſay, then it is not an evill thing to conſent unto; For that which is not evill in it ſelf, by my conſenting cannot become evill.</p>
            <p>It is not then the conſent following that makes the preceding motion to be evill, but it is the preceding evill motion that makes the ſubſequent conſent evill.</p>
            <p>Now as for <hi>Coſter</hi> his ſimilitude, it makes plainly againſt himſelf.</p>
            <p>For it is true indeed, that he who heareth evill ſpoken and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves it, is worthy of praiſe.</p>
            <p>But it is alſo true, that he who ſpake the evill hath ſinned; Even ſo albeit we doe well when we conſent not to the motions of concupiſcence in us.</p>
            <p>Yet concupiſcence is not the leſſe to be condemned; becauſe it hath ſent out into the eare of our Soul, the voyce of a filthy deſlre, which is not agreeable to Gods moſt holy Law.</p>
            <p>And of this Judgement with us, are alſo the ancient Fathers, <hi>Aug. Ser. de temp.</hi> 45. <hi>When I luſt,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>albeit I conſont not to my luſt, yet that is done in me which I will not, and which alſo the Law will not:</hi> And again, thy deſire ſhould in ſuch ſort be unto God, that there ſhould not be in thee at all ſo much as concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence which hath need of reſiſtance; for thou reſiſteſt and by not conſenting thou overcomeſt; but it were better not to have an enemy, than to overcome him.</p>
            <p>With him agrees alſo <hi>Bernard, That kinde of ſinne</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>which ſo often troubles us, I mean Concupiſcence and evill deſires, may, and ſhould be repreſſed by the Grace of God; ſo that it reigns not in us, and that we give not our Members weapons of unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe to ſin, and that way there is no damnation to them who are in Chriſt, yet it is not caſt out, but in death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From all which it is evident, that the motions of Concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence are evill and ſinfull, even when they are repreſſed, and no conſent given unto them.</p>
            <p>The Pelagians denyed Concupiſcence to be ſinne, but the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:168495:27"/>Law ſaith the contrary, <hi>Thou ſhalt not covet;</hi> and <hi>Rous.</hi> 7.7. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>I know no ſinne but by the Law, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Pelagians were condemned in many Councells ſummon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and gathered together, for confutation of <hi>Pelagius</hi> and <hi>Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtius</hi> their hereſies, about the year 420. and ſometime after, as in the Milevitan Councell, the fifth Councell of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and the Councell of <hi>Paleſtina</hi> in the Eaſt.</p>

               </label> Here is a fallacy taking that to be generally meant of the whole, which is ſpoken but in part.</p>
            <p>The formall of ſinne is taken away not ſimply, but as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the guilt of it.</p>
            <p>For there is double formall of ſinne.</p>
            <p>Firſt, a repugnancy with the Law, and an inclination to ſinne.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the guilt which is the ordaining of it to puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the guilt is taken away but the inclination abideth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.23. <hi>I ſee another Law in my members rebelling againſt the Law of my minde, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this you ſee that although originall Concupiſcence is not a free and voluntary tranſgreſſion of Gods Law, and ſo not ſinne as actuall ſinnes be, but an inbred perverſity of nature that oppoſeth the Law of God, and makes us apt to tranſgreſſe the ſame, it being like a fiery furnace, ſo hot though it yeeld no flames, yet it is ever ready to burn every combuſtible ſubſtance that lights upon it.</p>
            <p>Yet it is moſt apparent that it is a ſinne, and that prohibited in the tenth Commandement.</p>
            <p>This I hope may ſuffice in anſwer to theſe objections, which have been ſo fully confuted in former ages, that were not theſe men paſt all ſhame, they would never goe about to revive ſuch Hereſies, that we had hoped had long ſince been buried amongſt us.</p>
            <p>But ſo long as there is a Devill in Hell, and a Pope at <hi>Rome,</hi> we muſt never expect to be free from ſuch diſturbers of our peace.</p>
            <p>Come we now to the Scriptures which they alledge, and wreſt to maintain their errors, and againſt the truth of our poſition; that ſinne will have a being in the beſt of men, ſo long as their Souls have a being in theſe houſes of clay.</p>
            <p>The firſt Scripture that we may take notice that they cite, may be that in the <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.6. we that are baptized into Chriſt are baptized into his death, <hi>That the whole body of ſinne might be deſtroyed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From whence they conclude, That the corruption of old <hi>Adam</hi> is quite aboliſhed, and that they are perfectly quitted from ſinne, and perfectly renewed by Grace: Unto this I anſwer, as in part
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:168495:29"/>before, that the guilt of ſin, which the Schools term the form of ſin, this is taken away in baptiſme.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the corruption of ſin, which they call the matter of ſin, and this is likewiſe to be conſidered two wayes.</p>
            <p>Firſt, in reſpect of the dominion of ſin, and thus the matter of ſin is taken away from the elect, becauſe ſin in them is not like a Prince that ruleth over them, but like a Slave that rebelleth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in reſpect of the being of ſinne, and thus the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſinne is not taken away from Gods Saints, becauſe St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>The fleſh luſteth againſt the ſpirit, Gal.</hi> 5.17. and as he ſaith of himſelf, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.23.</p>
            <p>And therefore ſeeing the Apoſtle ſaith not, let not ſin be <hi>in your mortal bodies,</hi> but <hi>let not ſinne reign.</hi> If no ſin did remain there were no danger of reigning: And as <hi>Aug.</hi> hath well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, it is apparent that ſinne and concupiſcence is taken away in Baptiſme, <hi>Non ut non ſit, ſed ut ne obſit,</hi> not as touching the being of it, that we ſhould be without ſin; but as touching the rule of ſin, that it ſhould not hurt us, nor hinder us to attain unto everlaſting happineſſe.</p>
            <p>And ſo <hi>Anſelme</hi> ſaith in <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.6. <hi>That the body of ſinne is deſtroyed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not that our inbred corruption ſhould on the ſudden be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed in our fleſh that liveth, but that it may not be imputed to him that is dead, though it was in him while he lived.</p>
            <p>Becauſe ſin is deſtroyed not from having a being in us while we are alive, but that we ſhould not be compelled to ſerve it in our life, and that it ſhould not deprive us of eternall life.</p>

            <p>Firſt, To aſſure us that now ſin is like a ſerpent cruſhed in the head, according as God ſaid, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. <hi>That the promiſed ſeed ſhould bruiſe the Serpents head;</hi> and therefore can never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover his former ſtrength, nor any wayes hurt the regenerate man, but only to bruiſe his heel, that is, by the wrigling of her tail, to cauſe ſome temporary affliction to light upon them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, to ſignifie unto us that this ſhould be the main ſcope of all Saints, to ſtrive continually to mortifie the deeds of the fleſh, and to doe their beſt endeavors to be clean rid of them, <hi>and for to perfect holineſs in the fear of God,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1.</p>
            <p>And this is plainly intimated unto us in all the exhortations of the Scriptures, as where we are adviſed <hi>to abſtain from filthy luſts, and mortifie the deeds of the fleſh,</hi> and the like.</p>
            <p>For if there were no luſts, no deeds of the fleſh in us, to what end are we bidden to mortifie them?</p>

            <p>Secondly, He ſinneth not as he is regenerated, but he ſinneth as long as he abideth in this life, ſin not reigning in him, and yet ſometimes reigning too, as he is regenerated but in part, and in part carnall; For regeneration or renewing us to the Image of God, is not perfected in an inſtant, but is begun only in this life, as I have formerly ſhewed you, and in the life to come, is at length finiſhed; for ſo doth <hi>John</hi> himſelf pronounce of himſelf, and all the Saints in this life, 1 <hi>John.</hi> 1. <hi>If we ſay, &amp;c.</hi>

            <pb n="48" facs="tcp:168495:32"/>
            <p>But we doubt not but, maugre the malice of Men and Devils, truth ſhall be hereby made more manifeſt, and ſhall prevail.</p>
            <p>And the folly of thoſe that reſiſt the truth ſhall be made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all men. The Lord grant that we may obey the Apoſtles command, <hi>From ſuch to turn away,</hi> and the Lord in mercy ſtrengthen our faith in the beliefe of that promiſe, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.9. that in Gods good time it ſhall be performed. The promiſe is, <hi>They ſhall proceed no further.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Come we now to the ſecond Poſition, which is this. I deny that any man by grace in this life can perform ſuch perfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Law of God as not to offend againſt the ſame, or to be thereby juſtified otherwiſe than in and through Chriſt of grace given.</p>
            <p>And this, God aſſiſting, I ſhall clear as the former, dividing the ſame into three branches.</p>
            <list>
               <item>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, That no man by grace can perform ſuch perfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Law of God, as not to offend againſt the ſame.</item>
               <item>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, That no man can be juſtified by the works of the Law, or by his obedience thereunto.</item>
               <item>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, That we are only juſtified by the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt.</item>
            </list>
            <p>And firſt, of the firſt. No man can by grace in this life per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>For the better underſtanding the point we muſt know, that grace is an equivocall word, and it is taken two waies in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: Firſt, <hi>pro gratia gratis data:</hi> For the free guift of God infuſed into our hearts by the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly, <hi>pro gratia gratum faciente,</hi> for the free favour of God whereby he makes us acceptable to himſelf; and in this ſenſe we ſay that we are juſtified by Gods grace, that is, by the free favour of God, whereby he imputeth not our ſin unto us.</p>
            <p>But accompteth us as juſt, by imputing the juſtice of Chriſt unto us.</p>
            <p>Now according as grace is taken in the firſt ſenſe, I ſay that ſo no man by grace can perform in this life ſuch perfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Law of God, as not to offend againſt the ſame, or to be thereby juſtified, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>God never gave, or ever will give ſuch grace to any to fulfill
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:168495:32"/>the righteouſneſſe of the Law in their own perſons, and ſo there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by juſtified or found righteous by the ſame; for it ſtands not with the glory of Chriſt that any ſuch grace ſhould be given from above.</p>
            <p>And the reaſon may be this; If by our infirmities the ſtrength of Chriſt is made perfect: It muſt follow that by our ſtrength the virtue of Chriſts Croſſe muſt be abated, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9.</p>
            <p>And in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>God hath made Chriſt to be ſin for us who knew no ſin, that we might be made the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of God;</hi> as I ſaid before, he doth not ſay actively that we ſhould make or work our own righteouſneſſe; but paſſively, <hi>That we ſhould be made,</hi> that is <hi>ex indebita miſericordia,</hi> of Gods free mercy, <hi>the righteouſneſs of God,</hi> and that, <hi>Not by our ſelves, leſt we ſhould glory in our ſelves, but by another, Jeſus Chriſt, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for ever more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus the Apoſtle, 3 <hi>Phil.</hi> 9. relinquiſheth his own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, <hi>That he might be found in Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No man therefore by grace infuſed by the Holy Ghoſt can perform ſuch perfect obedience unto the Law of God in this life, as not to offend againſt the ſame, or to be thereby juſtified, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I grant that unto the Regenerate, the Law in ſome ſort is poſſible.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> As firſt concerning outward order and diſcipline.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly as concerning the imputation of Chriſts righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that is, by the benefit of juſtification and regeneration, both which benefits we obtein by faith: For ſuch God looketh upon in the face of his Son, <hi>in whom he is alone well pleaſed, Mat.</hi> 3.17.</p>
            <p>And his fulfilling the Law is their fulfilling, though not in the ſame manner, yet in as good effect as if it had been by themſelves done, and that thus.</p>
            <p>Hee for them, they by him; He actually performed, they by imputation; He by virtue and merit, they by gift and grace.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> And thirdly, as touching the beginning of inward and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward obedience in this life. <hi>This is the love of God, that we keep his Commandements,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.3. But the Law is impoſſible to the Regenerate in reſpect of God, that is, as touching the perfect inward and outward obedience of the Law, as <hi>Pſalme</hi>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:168495:33"/>143.2. <hi>Enter not into judgement with thy Servant, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> For firſt, They fulfill not the Law perfectly, becauſe they doe many things contrary to the Law. <hi>In many things we offend all, James</hi> 3.2.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And who knowes the errors of his life, &amp;c. Pſalme</hi> 19.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> And thoſe things alſo which they doe according to the Law are imperfect; For in the Regenerate, as I ſhewed you in the former poſition, there are many ſins yet remaining, as originall ſin, ignorances, and impurities, &amp;c. which they themſelves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and bewail, <hi>Iſay</hi> 64.6.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We have been as an vnclean thing, and all our righteouſneſſe is as filthy rags.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or thus, the perfect obedience to the Commandements of Gods Law is fulfilled in us two manner of wayes.</p>
            <p>Firſt, by application of Chriſts righteouſneſſe to us; He is our Head, and we his Members, and are ſo united with him, that now we are not to be taken as ſundry, but as one body with him.</p>
            <p>By virtue of the which Communion it comes to paſſe, that that which is ours is his, and that which is his is ours; So that in our Head we have fulfilled the Law, and ſatisfied Gods juſtice for our ſinnes, as I ſhewed you before.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, it will be fulfilled in us by our perfect ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though now we have but begun obedience, and in part.</p>
            <p>The Lord Jeſus at the laſt day, when the laſt enemie, which is death, ſhall be be ſubdued, ſhall bring it in us to perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>This is the end which Chriſt hath propoſed unto himſelf, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.26. and whereof he cannot be fruſtrate; as he hath begun it ſo he ſhall finiſh it.</p>
            <p>He ſhall conform us to the Law, the righteouſneſs thereof ſhall be fulfilled in us.</p>
            <p>There ſhall not be left in our nature ſo much as a ſinfull mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or deſire, but he ſhall at the laſt preſent us pure and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blame to his Father. He ſhall make us perfectly anſwerable to that holineſſe which the Law requireth, and in his own good time ſhall bring it to paſſe.</p>
            <p>But that the Law is fulfilled in men in this life, is denyed by
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:168495:33"/>ſome of their own fraternity. <hi>Sin is condemned,</hi> ſaith Cajetan, <hi>but not extinguiſhed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, the Apoſtle affirmeth poſſitively, That no man ſhall be juſtified by the works of the Law, as in <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.16. remarkable, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.4. <hi>Chriſt is the end of the Law for righteouſneſſe to all that believe:</hi> and in 2 <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. <hi>If righteouſneſſe come by the Law, then Chriſt died in vain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in the 3. and the 11.1. it is evident, that <hi>no man is justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Law, for the juſt ſhall live by faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in the 18. verſe, <hi>if the Inheritance be of the Law, it is no more of Promiſe:</hi> But God gave it to <hi>Abraham</hi> by promiſe, and it is Faith that anſwers the promiſe, obedience holds no propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with it.</p>
            <p>Again, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>For that that was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to the Law, in as much as it was weak becauſe of the fleſh, God ſending his own ſonne in the ſimilitude of ſinfull fleſh, and that for ſin condemned ſin in the fleſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where the Apoſtle, having in the firſt verſe ſet down a Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of comfort, belonging to them who are in Chriſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed it in the ſecond verſe, he here proceedeth to the explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the confirmation, and doth declare how it is, that Chriſt hath freed us from the Law of ſin: And firſt he ſheweth us in this place how Chriſt hath freed us from the condemning power of ſinne.</p>
            <p>Namely, that he, taking upon him our nature, and therewithall the burthen of our ſinnes, hath condemned ſinne in his bleſſed body, and ſo diſanulled it, that it hath no power to condemn us.</p>
            <p>And this benefit he amplifies, ſhowing that by no other means we could obtein it.</p>
            <p>For where without Chriſt there is but one way for men to come to life, namely, the obſervance of the Law,</p>
            <p>He lets us ſee it was impoſſible for the Law to ſave us.</p>
            <p>And leaſt it ſhould ſeem that he blamed the Law, he ſubjoyns, that this impotencie of the Law proceeds from ourſelves;</p>
            <p>Becauſe that we, through fleſhly corruption that is in us, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fulfill that righteouſneſſe which the Law requires.</p>
            <p>Now the impotencie of the Law appears in theſe two things.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, It craveth of us which we had not to give, namely, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect obedience unto all the Lords Commandements, and that
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:168495:34"/>under pain of death, which albeit moſt juſtly it be required of us, conſidering that by Creation we received from God a nature ſo holy that it was able to doe the Law, yet now by reaſon of the depravation of our nature, drawn on by our ſelves, it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that we can perform it.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, The Law could not give that unto us whereof wee ſtood in need, namely,</p>
            <p>That the infinite debt of Tranſgreſſion which we had contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, ſhould be forgiven unto us.</p>
            <p>This I ſay the Law could not doe, for the Law commands obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, but promiſes not pardon of diſobedience: Yea rather,</p>
            <p>It binds the curſe of God upon us for it.</p>
            <p>And again, We ſtand in need of a ſuparnaturall grace, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form deformed nature, and this alſo the Law could not doe, it being a doctrine that ſhews us the way of life, but doth not mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter grace unto us to walk therein.</p>
            <p>But all theſe which the Law could not doe, Jeſus Chriſt, by whom commeth grace and life, hath done unto us.</p>
            <p>Therefore there is no life to be found in the obſervance of the Law.</p>
            <p>It being impoſſible for the Law to give: They therefore that ſeeke life only in the obſervance thereof, ſhall never find it.</p>
            <p>Again, the Apoſtle in another place calls the Law the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of death and condemnation, and that becauſe it inſtantly bindes men under death, for every tranſgreſſion of her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements.</p>
            <p>So that he that hath eyes to ſee what an univerſall rebellion of nature there is in man to Gods holy Law:</p>
            <p>Yea what imperfections and diſcordance with the Law are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent in them, who are renewed by grace, may eaſily eſpy the blinde preſumption of thoſe who ſeek life in the miniſtry of death.</p>
            <p>Yet ſo univerſall is this error that it hath overgone the whole poſterity of <hi>Adam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nature teaching all men, who are not illuminated by Chriſt, to ſeek ſalvation in their own deeds, that is, to ſtand to the covenant of works:</p>
            <p>But the Supernaturall doctrine of the Evangeliſt teacheth us
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:168495:34"/>to tranſcend nature, to goe out of our ſelves, and to ſeek ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Lord Jeſus.</p>
            <p>And ſo to uſe the Law, not that we ſeek life by fulfilling it, which here is impoſſible, but as a School-maſter to lead us unto Chriſt, in whom we have remiſſion of our ſin, ſanctification of our nature, acceptance of our imperfect obedience, benefits which the Law could never afford us.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee it is impoſſible for us in our own perſons to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the Law of God, no ſuch grace being given from above, as I ſhewed you before, or if we could; yet it is not poſſible for the Law to ſave us, not in reſpect of any deſert or imperfection in the Law; <hi>For the Law is juſt, good, and holy, Rom.</hi> 7.12. But in regard of the corruption of our nature, which is not able to yeeld ſuch perfect obedience unto the Law as the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth.</p>
            <p>Nay, I ſay further, that although the Law be good, yet it is not good to this end, neither was it ordained of God for this purpoſe:</p>
            <p>For the Law was given to a double end.</p>
            <p>Firſt, common to all men, Secondly, proper to two ſorts of men. Firſt, to the Elect and Reprobates. Firſt, in reſpect of all men the Law was given,</p>
            <p>Firſt, to ſhew unto all men what was ſin; for by the Law commeth the knowledge of ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. and I had not known that luſt had been ſin, had not the Law ſaid thou ſhalt not luſt.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, to ſhew the wrath of God for ſinne, and by the tranſgreſſion thereof to make all men ſee how juſtly they be worthy of eternal death. And therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. that the Law cauſeth wrath, and is the miniſtry of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, becauſe it ſheweth unto us how juſtly we deſerve wrath and condemnation.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, to be a rule of righteouſneſſe to reſtrain all men from ſin, and to retein them in a civill courſe of living for the common good of humane ſociety.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, the Law was given to theſe two proper ends, Firſt in reſpect of the Reprobate, to make them without excuſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Law teacheth them what ſhould be done, and what ſhould be left undone.</p>
            <pb n="54" facs="tcp:168495:35"/>
            <p>And therefore it leaves them without excuſe, if they leave the one and commit the other.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, In reſpect of the elect the Law was given to be a means, by the ſight of their ſinnes to ſeek out a Saviour, that ſhould deliver them from their ſinnes. And in this reſpect,</p>
            <p>As he that informeth us of ſome dangerous diſeaſe, doth tacit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adviſe us to ſeek for ſome expert Phyſitian;</p>
            <p>So is the Law ſaid to be our Schoolmaſter to teach us by the manifeſtation of our ſinnes, to ſeek unto Chriſt for our delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
            <p>But the Law was never intended to that end, that it ſhould juſtifie us, and of it ſelf bring us to eternall life.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> For firſt, if eternall life had been promiſed only to them that keep the Law, then the promiſe had been made vain, becauſe it was impoſſible for our corrupt nature to perform it.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, if righteouſneſſe could have come by Law, then Chriſt had died in vain; becauſe it was ſuperfluous for him to dye for us, when as we might procure life, by the works of the Law.</p>
            <p>And therefore it is apparent that <hi>by the works of the Law, no fleſh living can be juſtified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, For hypocriticall Goſpellers ſuch as ſeem Saints in oſtentation, that they may play the Divels without ſupicion, which ſay they have Faith, but ſhew no works that are not vayled with hypocriſie and intended to wrong ends, let <hi>Eſayas</hi> tell you how acceptable theſe works are to God? <hi>Eſay</hi> 1. and, whether they be like to juſtifie them before God, or not?</p>
            <p>For the Lord complayneth, that he is weary of them, that his Soul hateth them, and biddeth them to bring no more ſuch ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice unto him.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, For the true Chriſtians that are born, not of Blood, nor of the Will of the Fleſh, but of God,</p>
            <p>If any works could juſtifie, it muſt needs be that their works wrought in them, and thorow them, by the Spirit of God, ſhould juſtifie them.</p>
            <p>And yet we ſay, that the beſt works of the beſt regenerate men, cannot juſtifie them before God: And thus we prove it.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, Becauſe all the Graces that we receive in this life, are
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:168495:35"/>but in part given unto us, as I ſhewed in the proof of the other poſition, and ſo imperfect Graces: Not that the Spirit of God works imperfectly, but that he means not here to inrich us with any Grace, while we are converſant with ſinfull men in this vale of miſery, but only ſo farre forth as he ſeeth fit to bring us to the Kingdome of perfection, <hi>where that which is in part ſhall be done away,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.10. and therefore our inherent juſtice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but as our knowledge in part, and therefore imperfect, it is impoſſible that it ſhould perfectly juſtifie us before God.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Becauſe that although our good works are perfect, in reſpect of Gods Spirit which effecteth them.</p>
            <p>Yet ſeeing as fair water is defiled by running through a dirty Channell, ſo our beſt works are tainted, when they paſſe through us that are ſo ſubject to ſinne, and ſo many times polluted with ſo many iniquities.</p>
            <p>It is unpoſſible we ſhould be juſtified before him, in whoſepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence nothing in the leaſt manner polluted can ſtand uncondem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: and therefore as the Prophet ſaith <hi>all our righteouſneſſe is as aſtained clothe, Eſay</hi> 64.6.</p>
            <p>And as <hi>Gregory</hi> ſaith, <hi>Moral. lib.</hi> 21. <hi>cap.</hi> 15. <hi>&amp; lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. <hi>All mens righteouſneſſe ſhould be found unrighteouſneſſe, if God ſhould ſtrictly Judge it:</hi> And <hi>Aug. Wo to the moſt laudable and beſt life of man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If God laying aſide his mercy ſhould diſcuſſe the ſame in the ſtrictneſſe of his Juſtice; for alas! who knoweth not, that God is a God of pure eyes, which found folly in his Angels?</p>
            <p>And the beſt of men whileſt he lives on earth is both a Saint and a ſinner.</p>
            <p>A Saint, by reaſon of Gods Grace wrought in him.</p>
            <p>And a Sinner, by reaſon of his own naturall corruption, which, in ſome meaſure, tainteth every Grace of God.</p>
            <p>And therefore not only the worſt of men, but alſo the beſt of Gods Saints, that being compared with their fellowes, might ſeem juſt indeed.</p>
            <p>Yet looking to the ſtrictneſſe of Gods juſtice, they diſclaimed all their own righteouſneſſe, and relyed wholly upon the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of God: ſo <hi>Job</hi> 4.17, 18, 19. and <hi>Job</hi> 15.14. and 9.2.3. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 143.2. and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,

That is, if you ſeek to be ſaved or juſtified by the works of the Law, then are you bound to fulfill the whole Law, and ſo you have no need of Chriſt.

            <p>But then it may be objected, That it is to no purpoſe to doe good works, if we can neither be juſtified by them, nor merit by them.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, That as gold is good, yet not to aſſwage hunger;

            <p>We might ſue unto the Throne of Grace for mercy, and for the gracious aſſiſtance of his holy Spirit, whereby we may be enabled in ſome meaſure to perform that which he ſo juſty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Auguſt.</hi> ſaith, <hi>In the Commandement we muſt know what we ought to have: In the puniſhment we muſt learn, that we our ſelves are the cauſe of all our wants.</hi>

               </gap> we muſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the defects, that is, from God.</p>
            <p>Or to anſwer more methodically, I ſay, That God, being on Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> to deliver a Law, not <hi>de novo,</hi> that was never given before, but ſuch as was formerly engraven in mans heart, and now defaced and obliterated through ſinne;</p>
            <p>It was not for him to bend the Rule of Righteouſneſſe, to the crookedneſſe of our affections to make it anſwerable to our abilities:</p>
            <p>But rather to ſet down a ſtraight Rule;</p>
            <p>Not in favour of our ſinfull nature, but to expreſſe our whole duty, though it be impoſſible for us to perform it, now after we have loſt our ability.</p>
            <p>For as he that lent thee a thouſand pounds, may without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice demand the ſame of thee, when he knoweth that thou through thy laviſhneſſe haſt ſpent all, and as a Bankrupt, art not able to pay one penny;</p>
            <p>So God, having given us power to obey all his precepts, may at any time moſt juſtly call for the performance of the ſame, though he knoweth that we, by our ſinnes, have made our ſelves unable ſo much as to think a good thought, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5.</p>
            <p>But our Adverſaries have and doe further object, <hi>That a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:168495:37"/>man hath</hi> ſufficientia principia rectae operationis, <hi>ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cauſes and means of well doing; as knowledge to underſtand what is good, will to deſire what is good, and power to effect what is good, his ſoul being enlightned, ſanctified, and aſſiſted by Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; therefore he may doe what is good, and all what God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, That we grant a regenerate man to be enabled to doe good, but how farre enabled?</p>
            <p>Surely not perfectly, for our knowledge is but in part, obſcured with ignorance; our will is diſtempered with many turbulent affections, and our power hindred to doe many good things we would doe, by many luſtfull temptations.</p>
            <p>And therefore theſe <hi>principia operationis</hi> being not <hi>perfecta principia,</hi> our actions cannot be perfect which proceed from them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Who can tell,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, how oft he offendeth? Cleanſe thou me from my ſecret ſinnes.</hi>

            <p>I may have many ſinnes, and fail in many things, which no man knoweth of, nor my ſelf, but only known to God.</p>
            <p>I may ſin, and not know mine own ſin, yet God ſeeth the ſame.</p>
            <p>We cannot judge mens hearts, for we know not our own; it is Gods preroagative <hi>to ſearch and try the Reines, Jer.</hi> 17.9.1 <hi>John</hi> 3.20.</p>
            <p>And it is our duty to pray with <hi>Nehemiah</hi> 13.12. <hi>Accept my obedience, but pardon mine iniquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That choſen veſſell was compelled to ſay this, although he knew nothing by himſelf, yet he knew that thereby he could not be juſtified.</p>
            <p>And this I hope may ſuffice, for the cleering the firſt Branch of the ſecond Poſition, That no man can perform ſuch perfect obedience to the Law of God, as not to offend againſt the ſame; or by his obedience thereunto, be juſtified before God.</p>
            <p>And for further confirmation of the truth thereof, I dare ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale to any mans conſcience, if he be not too arrogant, how upon the confirmation of Gods ſtrict Judgement, and his own manifold infirmities, he dares juſtifie himſelf in any one act a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God?</p>
            <pb n="60" facs="tcp:168495:38"/>
            <p>And I doubt not but the proudeſt heart would ſoon tremble, and the boldeſt face would bluſh and be aſhamed and affraid to have his beſt works, even his prayers ſcan'd according to the ſtrictneſſe of Gods Law, or the rigor of Gods Juſtice:</p>
            <p>And of the adverſaries to this truth, I require this one thing, That they will either produce a man, and prove it,</p>
            <p>That hath ever performed in his own perſon, ſuch perfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Law of God, as not to offend againſt the ſame:</p>
            <p>Or elſe let them acknowledge their error with ſhame, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear oppoſing the truth and diſturbing the peace of Gods Church.</p>
            <p>Leſt by perſiſting in their malicious wickedneſſe, their ſinne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come unpardonable.</p>
            <p>I ſhall pray for them as for my ſelf, that the Lord would be pleaſed to convince us of the errors of our waies, humble us in the ſenſe of our ſinnes, and be mercifull to our poor Souls.</p>
            <p>Come we now to the ſecond Branch of the ſecond Poſition, which hath in it theſe two parts to be conſidered.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>That no man can be juſtified by the works of the Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>That we are only juſtified by the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And firſt, of the firſt. In part I have cleered it before, but for further confirmation,</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> reaſons admirably and plainly in this point, ſaying, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.6.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If Salvation be of Grace, it is no more of works; for elſe were Grace no more Grace: And if it be of works it is no more of Grace; for elſe works were no more works. But Salvation is of Grace; for by Grace yee are ſaved through Faith, and that not of your ſelves: It is the gift of God, not of works, leſt any man ſhould boaſt, Eph.</hi> 2.8.</p>
            <p>And our Saviour tells us plainly, that when we have done our beſt, <hi>We are but unprofitable Servants; Ergo,</hi> Salvations is not of works.</p>
            <p>Again Reaſon it ſelf, drawn from the Scriptures, doth ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently prove, that we cannot be juſtified by our works:</p>
            <p>For if any works doe juſtifie us, they muſt be done either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore or after juſtification. But,</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, no works done before the Grace of juſtification, can juſtifie us;</p>
            <pb n="61" facs="tcp:168495:38"/>
            <p>Becauſe <hi>evill trees cannot bring forth good fruit,</hi> and being not done of Faith, they muſt needs be ſinne; for whatſoever is not done of Faith is ſinne: <hi>and without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God, Heb.</hi> 11.6.</p>
            <p>Whereupon Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, That all men before they be ingrafted into Chriſt by Grace <hi>are the Servants of ſinne, farre from righteouſneſſe,</hi> and bringing forth nothing, but fruits deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſhame and death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.20.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Our works done after Grace, Reaſon it ſelf ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, That they cannot be the cauſe of Grace; for how can that which commeth after, be any cauſe of that which goeth before.</p>
            <p>The cauſe muſt precede the effect.</p>
            <p>And ſo <hi>Auguſt.</hi> tells us, <hi>That good works doe not goe before him, that is to be juſtified, but doe follow him that is already juſtified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore, as good fruits cannot be the cauſe of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the tree; ſo good works cannot be the cauſe of juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
            <p>And that place of the Apoſtle which I cited before, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.20. makes it cleer, <hi>By the works of the Law, no fleſh ſhall be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For firſt, in the 9. <hi>ver.</hi> he tells us, <hi>That both Jews and Gentiles are under ſinne, becauſe all are tranſgreſſors of the Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore all the world muſt be guilty before God, and can no wayes be juſtified by pretending innocency in keeping the Law.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He ſheweth the Reaſon, why no fleſh can be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Law; becauſe the Law convinceth us of ſinne; for by the Law commeth the knowledge of ſinne:</p>
            <p>But the Law convinceth them that are under Grace, and which hath the greateſt meaſure of Grace, to be ſinners, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9.</p>
            <p>Therefore they that doe the works of the Law, by the help of Grace, cannot be juſtified by the Law; becauſe the Law ſheweth them likewiſe to be ſinners, as well, though not as great, as they that endeavour to keep the Law without the help of Grace:</p>
            <p>And therefore the Apoſtle concludeth, <hi>That we are all juſtified by the righteouſneſſe of God, without the Law;</hi> as you may ſee in <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. from 2. <hi>ver.</hi> therefore not by any righteouſneſſe of the Law, done either by the help of Grace or without Grace;</p>
            <p>For he that obeyeth the Law, how ever he doth it, with the help
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:168495:39"/>of Grace or his own ſtrength, yet he hath the ſame righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
            <p>The righteouſneſſe of the Law, becauſe the different manner of obteining it altereth not the nature of the thing.</p>
            <p>But the Apoſtle ſheweth a great difference betwixt the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of the Law and the righteouſneſs of Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For Moſes deſcribeth the righteouſneſſe which is of the Law, That the man which doth theſe things</hi> (however he doth them, by his own ſtrength, or ſome other help, if he doth them) <hi>he ſhall live by them, Rom.</hi> 10.5. <hi>But the righteouſneſſe of Faith ſpeaketh on this wiſe, If thou ſhalt confeſſe with thy mouth the Lord Jeſus, and believe in thine heart that God raiſed him from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved, ver.</hi> 6.9.</p>
            <p>And therefore ſeeing the Apoſtle oppoſeth doing of the Law, and believing in Chriſt, and not doing the Law by our own ſtrength, and doing the Law by the help of grace,</p>
            <p>It is apparent, That we can never be juſtified by the works of the Law, by what means ſoever we doe them, whether by the ſtrength of nature, or by the help of grace.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Bellarm.</hi> in his firſt Book, <hi>cap.</hi> 19. <hi>de juſtific.</hi> laboureth to prove, that all works of the Law are not excluded from our Juſtification by three eſpeciall Reaſons.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, Becauſe Faith is a Work, and that there is a Law of Faith as well as of Works; and therefore if all Works be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from our Juſtification, then Faith it ſelf muſt be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded:</p>
            <p>And ſo to be juſtified by Faith, were to be juſtified without Faith.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Becauſe the Apoſtles intent, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. That neither the Jewes by the bare obſerving of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, nor the Gentiles by their morall Works:</p>
            <p>And ſo neither Jewes nor Gentiles, before they believed in Jeſus Chriſt, could be juſtified by any Works that they could doe.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Becauſe the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.4. ſheweth, That the Works which he excludeth from Juſtification, are thoſe Works to whom wages are due, by debt, not by grace; <hi>and thoſe</hi> (ſaith <hi>Bellarmine</hi>) <hi>are all ſuch Works as are done by our own natural abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,

            </p>
            <p>But for anſwer unto all theſe, I ſay,</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> That we confeſs Faith to be a Work, and it is the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of God, That we believe in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But we deny Faith to juſtifie us, as it is a Work performed in obedience to this command, but as it is an Inſtrument imbracing the righteouſneſſe of Jeſus Chriſt: It is not the act of beleiving, but the thing holden and poſſeſſed by believing, that is, our righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, I ſay, That <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is miſtaken in the whole ſcope of the Apoſtle, and that St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth not only not give us the leaſt intimation that he meaneth that we are not juſtified by any works done by our own naturall ſtrength.</p>
            <p>But rather ſheweth, that in as much as we are all ſinners a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Law; therefore by our obedience to the Law, howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever done by grace, or without grace, no man can be juſtified in Gods ſight.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, I ſay, That the Apoſtle in <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.4. intendeth no ſuch diſtinction of Works, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> alledgeth, but he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth all Works, as well thoſe that are done by the help of grace, as that are done without grace, from the Juſtification of <hi>Abraham:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For thoſe Works of <hi>Abraham</hi> are excluded wherein <hi>Abraham</hi> might glory before men; but theſe are the Works that he did by the help of grace; for otherwiſe if he were juſtified by the Works done without the help of grace, he might as well glory before God as before men.</p>
            <p>But the Apoſtle tells us, That although by theſe Works, done by the help of grace, he might glory before men, yet not before God;</p>
            <p>And therefore not juſtified by theſe works in the ſight of God.</p>
            <p>For if we could be juſtified by any works, howſoever done by grace or not grace, then the wages (that is eternal life) is not counted of favour, but of debt: But when we cannot be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by our works, but by believing in him that juſtifieth the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly that is in Jeſus Chriſt, that we are juſtified by his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and ſaved by his merits; <hi>Then Faith,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:168495:40"/>
               <hi>and not any kinde of Works, is imputed unto us for righteouſneſſe, Romans</hi> 4.5.</p>
            <p>I ſhall then cloſe this point with theſe concluſions.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, That no man, which is a ſinner, can be juſtified by his own obedience to the moral Law.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, That no man, which hath offended the Law, can be juſtified by his own ſatisfaction for his tranſgreſſion.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Whoſoever is a tranſgreſſor of the Law, cannot be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by his obedience to the Law; <hi>For by the Law commeth the knowledg of ſinne, Rom.</hi> 3.20.</p>
            <p>That is, the Law convinceth all ſuch to be ſinners, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth them as tranſgreſſors:</p>
            <p>And therefore, they can never be pronounced guiltleſs by that Law which proves them guilty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But every man is a Tranſgreſſor of the Law,</hi> as the Scripture teacheth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.1 <hi>John</hi> 1.8. <hi>and</hi> 10. and our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences teſtifie it to our faces.</p>
            <p>Therefore no man can be juſtified by his own obedience to the Law.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, That a ſinner, which hath once offended, can never by any action or paſſion of his own make ſatisfaction to the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God for his trangreſſion.</p>
            <p>And the Law being broken, there is no way to be juſtified by the Law, but only by making a plenary ſatisfaction for the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion.</p>
            <p>But this no ſinners ſatisfaction can doe; becauſe a finite Act can never be of ſufficient value, to ſatisſie the offence that is done againſt an infinite goodneſſe:</p>
            <p>And likewiſe, becauſe all that we can doe is required of us as our duty to the Law, and therefore cannot be rendred as a payment for the breach of the Law.</p>
            <p>To conclude this branch, We are not under the Law for ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification of our perſons, as <hi>Adam;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor for ſatisfaction of divine juſtice, as thoſe that periſh; but we are under it as a document of obedience and a rule of living.</p>
            <p>It is now publiſhed from Mount Sion as a Law of liberty, and a new Law, not as a Law of condemnation and bondage.</p>
            <pb n="65" facs="tcp:168495:40"/>
            <p>The obedience thereof is not removed, but the diſobedience thereof is both pardoned and cured.</p>
            <p>The obſervance thereof is neceſſary as a fruit of faith, not as a condition of life and righteouſneſs, neceſſary <hi>neceſſitate Praecepti,</hi> as a thing commanded; the tranſgreſſion whereof is an incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of ſin; not <hi>neceſſitate Medii,</hi> as a ſtrict undiſponſible means of Salvation, the tranſgreſſion whereof, is a peremptory obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to death.</p>
            <p>And thus much briefly of the firſt branch; wherein I have cleerly ſhewed unto you, That no man can be juſtified by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the Law, nor the works of the beſt Chriſtians cannot juſtifie them.</p>
            <p>Come we now to the laſt Branch, and that is, That we are only juſtified by the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>We believe and maintain, as the Scripture teacheth us, <hi>That we are acquitted and abſolved from all our ſinnes, and ſo juſtified in the ſight of God, by and for the righteouſneſſe of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. <hi>As by the offence of one, Judgement came upon all men to condemnation; ſo by the righteouſneſſe of one, the free gift came upon all men to juſtification of life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. laſt <hi>verſ. He that knew no ſin, God hath made him to be ſin for us, that we ſhould be made the righteouſneſs of God by him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in <hi>Act.</hi> 13.39. <hi>For all things which yee could not be juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Law of Moſes, by him every one that believeth is juſtified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. <hi>Ye are juſtified,</hi> that is, in whole, from the guilt and puniſhment due to you for your ſinnes, <hi>in the name of the Lord Jeſus,</hi> that is, for the merits and righteouſneſſe of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But ſome may here object and ſay, The Righteouſneſſe is Chriſts, and how can a man be juſtified by the juſtice of another?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, As ſinne is ours by propagation, ſo righteouſneſſe is ours by imputatiou: and as <hi>Adam</hi> derived ſinne by nature to our condemnation, ſo Chriſt brought life by his obedience to our juſtification.</p>
            <p>So if <hi>many be made ſinners by the diſobedience of one man;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then how much more ſhall <hi>many be made righteous by the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of one man?</hi> eſpecially, ſeeing the nature of Chriſt was farr
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:168495:41"/>more divine, than the nature of <hi>Adam,</hi> and thee fore more powerfull in ability to work this effect to juſtifie us, than <hi>Adam</hi>'s was to condemn us? And in 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.11, 12. <hi>That eternall life which God giveth us,</hi> that is, that righteouſneſſe whereby he bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us to eternall life, <hi>is in his Sonne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this the Apoſtle doth moſt excellently ſhew unto us, when he ſaith, that <hi>God made Chriſt to be ſinne for us,</hi> and as in the place before cited, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20.</p>
            <p>For as our ſinnes were made the ſinnes of Chriſt, not by altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them inheſively into his own perſon, but by aſſumption of them imputatively to make ſatisfaction for them, as fully and as truly as if they had been his own inherent ſinnes.</p>
            <p>Even ſo the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt is as truly made ours by imputation, as if we had moſt perfectly fullfilled the Law, by our own actuall operation.</p>
            <p>And therefore juſtification is a gracious and judiciall action of God, whereby he judgeth the elect, being in themſelves liable to the accuſation and condemnation of the Law, to be juſt and righteous by faith in Jeſus Chriſt, through the imputation of his Juſtice, to the praiſe of his glorious power, and the eternall ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of their ſouls.</p>
            <p>Now for the Canſes of juſtification: they are eſpecially, firſt, Efficient, ſecondly, Materiall, thirdly, Formall fourthly, Finall; and each one of theſe muſt be conſidered two wayes: firſt, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively, in reſpect of him that juſtifies us; ſecondly, Paſſively, in reſpect of Man that is juſtified Firſt, The principall efficient Cauſe of this our juſtification actively conſidered, is <hi>God freely purpoſing to ſend his ſonne to be made man, to work righteouſneſſe for men.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Gal</hi> 4 4. then <hi>in the fulneſſe of time ſending his ſon made of a woman, made under the Law;</hi> then revealing his ſon to us by the preaching of the Goſpell, and perſwading us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the ſame; and to lay hold on the ſonne of God, by the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his bleſſed Spirit, and then accounting to us the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of his ſon for our righteouſneſſe.</p>
            <p>To ſhew that he is the beginning, the middle, the end of our juſtification: And to prove this, the Lord himſelf ſaith, <hi>Iſay</hi> 43.25. <hi>I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy tranſgreſſions for my own ſake, and will not remember thy ſinnes.</hi> And the Apoſtle plainly
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:168495:41"/>ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33. <hi>It is God that juſtifieth:</hi> And the very Scribes that rejected Chriſt moſt impiouſly, profeſſed this moſt truly, that <hi>none can forgive ſinnes but God only:</hi> And ſo <hi>Gregory</hi> ſaith, <hi>It is meet that he ſhould be the giver of Grace, which was the author of nature: Gregory in Pſal. poenitent.</hi> pithily ſaith, <hi>It is his office to abſolve the guilty, by whoſe juſtice he is made guilty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, The impulſive Cauſe, that moved God to doe all this for man, wee finde to be two fold, firſt Internall, ſecondly Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, The meer Grace and free Mercy of God towards man, and that becauſe he would be mercifull unto man.</p>
            <p>Becauſe we can aſcribe none other Cauſe of Gods Will, which is the cauſe of all things, but only this, <hi>Quia voluit,</hi> becauſe it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him: And therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> attributeth our Redemption to <hi>the Riches of h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> Grace,</hi> 1. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6, 7. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24. and ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in 3. <hi>Tit.</hi> 4. he ſaith, that <hi>after the kindneſſe and love of God our Saviour towards man appeared, not by works of righteouſneſſe which we have done, but according to his mercy he ſaved us, by the waſhing of Regeneration, and the renewing of the Holy Ghoſt, which he ſhed in us abundantly, through Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour:</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you ſee the Apoſtle maketh the Kindeneſſe, and Love, and Mercy of God to be the firſt efficient principal Cauſe or Motive, that moved God to ſend Chriſt to be the means to ſave us.</p>
            <p>And St. <hi>Aug. in Pſal</hi> 30. <hi>Idoe, de nat. &amp; grat.</hi> ſaith, <hi>That it is the ineffable grace of God, that a man, guilty of ſin, ſhould be juſtified from ſin;</hi> And eſpecialy, againſt the Pelagian Hereſie, that magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied nature to vilifie, and almoſt to nullifie Grace: He ſaith, <hi>That the grace of God, whereby Infants and men of years are ſaved, is not procured by deſerts, but tendered freely without merits:</hi> And ſo <hi>Anſelmus in Rom.</hi> 12. ſaith, <hi>That becauſe all men are ſhut up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſin, the Salvation of man commeth not in the Merits of men, but in the Mercy of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond is, Chriſt, God and Man, which purchaſed by his Merits, that we ſhould be juſtified in the ſight of God, becauſe <hi>the chaſtiſement of our peace was laidupon him, that we by his ſtripes might be healed, Iſay</hi> 55.5.</p>
            <pb n="68" facs="tcp:168495:42"/>
            <p>Secondly, The material Cauſe of our juſtification actively conſidered, is Jeſus Chriſt: And the benefits we have by Chriſt are eſpecially two; Firſt, Redemption, Secondly, Propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Redemption is a word borrowed from the uſe of warres, and it ſignifieth freedome from captivity: And thus Chriſt is our deliverance.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>From the wrath of God:</hi> Becauſe <hi>he is our reconciliation unto God, through faith in his blood, Rom.</hi> 3.25.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>From the Tyranny and Dominion of ſinne:</hi> Becauſe, <hi>That obeying from the heart the form of Doctrine which is delivered us,</hi> that is, the Goſpell of Chriſt, <hi>we are made free from ſin, and are become the ſervants of Chriſt, which is our Righteouſneſs, Rom.</hi> 6 18</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>From the puniſhment of ſinne:</hi> Becauſe it is againſt Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, that the puniſhment ſhould be inflicted when the ſinne is pardoned.</p>
            <p>For ſinne being the cauſe of puniſhment, it muſt needs follow, that <hi>ſublata cauſa, &amp;c.</hi> the cauſe being defaced, the effect muſt be aboliſhed.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
               </label> But againſt this it may be objected, That the ſinnes of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect are pardoned, and yet they are continually afflicted, and, as the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.13. <hi>Chaſtiſed every morning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore how can it be, that albeit he forgiveth the guilt of their ſinnes, yet, as the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 99.8. <hi>he puniſheth their inventions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Sol. </seg>
               </label> I anſwer, That the miſeries of men before the pardon of ſinne, are the puniſhments of ſinne; but the afflictions of the Saints, after the remiſſion of their ſinnes, are not to be reputed penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties from Gods anger, but exerciſes of his Servants, and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his love: <hi>For as many as I love, I rebuke and chaſten, Rev.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.6. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that for a double end; Firſt, principally, for our Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>that wee may not be condemned with the World,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.32.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Subordinately, for our Sanctification, <hi>That we may be partakers of his holineſſe, Heb.</hi> 12.10.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Propitiation is a reconciling us to God, through the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:168495:42"/>blood of Chriſt, and it is the accompliſhment of that which was typified by the Mercy-Seat, <hi>Exodus chap.</hi> 30.</p>
            <p>For firſt, As God gave his Oracles unto the people out of the Mercy Seat; ſo he did reveal his will unto us by Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 1.17.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As God was ſaid <hi>to dwell between the Cherubims which covered the Mercy-Seat;</hi> ſo <hi>in Chriſt the fullneſſe of the Godhead dwelleth bodily, Coloſſ.</hi> 2.9.</p>
            <p>And thirdly, As God was made propitious and favourable to his people, to aſſiſt them, and bleſſe them, by the blood which the High Prieſt ſprinkled before the Mercy Seat; ſo is God pacifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and reconciled unto us, and procured to enrich us with ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall bleſſings, through the blood of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.18.</p>
            <p>Again, The ground of thoſe benefits, or meritorious cauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, is the moſt perfect and abſolute obedience which our Saviour Chriſt performed unto his Father, for our ſakes; and is to be conſidered, firſt actively, ſecondly paſſively.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the active obedience of Chriſt is, a moſt perfect perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of Gods Law, even to the utmoſt tittle thereof. Touching which we muſt conſider,</p>
            <p>Firſt, That although Chriſt, as Man, fulfilled the Law for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that in both natures he might be a holy High-Prieſt, to offer Sacrifice unto God;</p>
            <p>Yet, as Mediator, as God and Man, he became ſubject to the Law; and did fully and perfectly execute the ſame for us.</p>
            <p>For Chriſt is not only our redemption, by that ranſome which he paid for our ſinnes; but he is alſo the perfection of the Law unto Salvation, unto every one that believeth.</p>
            <p>And there be three things that prove the neceſſity hereof, to be performed for us.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>The Juſtice of God, that will not juſtifie the wicked, Pro</hi> 17 15. <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.5. but ſuch as are juſt and righteous, either by a proper, or imputed rigteouſneſſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Office of a Mediator, that was to undergoe for us whatſoever was required of us to be done.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Our recuperation or recovery of happineſſe, which could not be obteined without perfect righteouſneſs; becauſe the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:168495:43"/>death of Chriſt freeth us from eternall death, and the obedience of Chriſt brings us to everlaſting life.</p>
            <p>And therfore we ſay, That Chriſt was born for us, not only <hi>auferre peccata,</hi> to take away the ſin of the World, by his volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary <hi>ſuffering the moſt bitter death of the Croſſe;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>afferre Juſtitia,</hi> to bring righteouſneſſe to us, by his plena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry obedience to the moſt holy Law of God.</p>
            <p>And therefore thoſe Scriptures that doe aſcribe our whole Salvation unto the virtue of Chriſts death, are not to be taken excluſively, or denying the active obedience of Chriſt to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted unto us.</p>
            <p>But Synechdochically, for the accompliſhment of the whole obedience of Chriſt that was to be performed for us: and with this agrees the <hi>major</hi> and <hi>melior</hi> part of all orthodox Divines and moſt of the Fathers.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The paſſive obedience of Chriſt, is all the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Chriſt both in life and death for our ſinnes; becauſe the juſtice of God required, that we ſhould never be freed from death without a juſt puniſhment, laid upon our ſelves or upon ſome other for us.</p>
            <p>And therefore the Prophet <hi>Iſay</hi> prophecied. <hi>That the Meſſias ſhould be broken for our tranſgreſſions, and bruiſed for our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Eſay</hi> 5.35.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaith, <hi>He ſhould be cut off, but not for himſef, Dan.</hi> 9.26.</p>
            <p>And St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>He did bear our ſinnes in his own body on the Croſſe,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. and St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. <hi>That he waſhed us from our ſinnes in his own blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here we muſt obſerve, that this obedience of Chriſt, is of ſufficient merit to ſatisfie for all ſinnes, by reaſon of the dignity of the perſon that did obey; for the hypoſtaticall union of the Manhood of Chriſt with his Godhead makes the obedience of Chriſt to be of unvaluable value, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The formall cauſe of our juſtification, actively con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, is the free imputation of Chriſts actuall righteouſneſſe, whereby the merits of Chriſts obedience is applyed unto all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, that is, the accompting of us as juſt and righteous, for
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:168495:43"/>the merrits of that obedience which Chriſt hath effected for us;</p>
            <p>For as we apply unto our ſelves the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, and make the ſame our own, by Faith and acceptation;</p>
            <p>So God himſelf applyeth it unto us by imputation, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth us for righteous, for the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And this imputation of righteouſneſſe, is a work of Grace, not of nature, a communicating of anothers righteouſneſſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us; and not a conferring of any reall or habituall righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe upon us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And this is a ſweet exchange,</hi> ſaith <hi>Juſtin Martyr in Epiſt. ad Diogen. That one ſhould be made ſinne for many, and the iniquity of many ſhould be covered with the righteouſneſſe of one: and that the juſtice of one ſhould make many that are unjust, to be reputed juſt.</hi> To omit what moſt of the Fathers ſpeaks to this purpoſe: I ſhall only note one of their own, <hi>Fryar Farrus, Ser.</hi> 1. <hi>in Dom.</hi> 1. <hi>Advent.</hi> where he ſaith, <hi>Chriſt hath made all his partakers of his juſtice and merits; that ſo they might be able to ſtand in the ſight, and to ſuſtain the judgement of God;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Becauſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>there is no mortall man living; whoſe righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe can be ſufficient to attain unto eternall Salvation:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore his righteouſneſſe is made ours; not, becauſe it is infuſed or tranſlated into us, to abide habitually in us:</p>
            <p>But, becauſe it is imputed and reputed unto us; when God doth acquit from ſinne, and adjudge us juſt, for the juſtice of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And therefore the force of our juſtification, is not any habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſanctity, ſubjectively remaining in us;</p>
            <p>But the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, freely imputed unto us; and ſo though it be without us, yet it is made ours by right of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle remarkably in <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.6.7. joyneth both <hi>the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of righteouſneſſe,</hi> and <hi>the remiſſion of ſinnes,</hi> as the two ſpeciall means to make us happy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bleſſed is the man, unto whom God imputeth righteouſneſſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out works: And bleſſed is the man; to whom the Lord will not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute ſinne.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="72" facs="tcp:168495:44"/>
            <p>But this righteouſneſſe of Chriſt imputed unto us, muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in a three fold reſpect.</p>
            <p>Firſt, In reſpect of the truth of our imputed righteouſneſſe: And ſo we ſay, that we are as truly righteous before God, as Chriſt himſelf; becauſe we are righteous with the ſime righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, as he is righteous.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In reſpect of the quantity: But ſo we deny that it is in the ſame meaſure in us as it is in him: for in him it is in its fulneſſe and largeſt meaſure; but in us it is only received, ſo farre forth as it ſerveth to juſtifie any particular Believer.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, In reſpect of the quality: And ſo we ſay, That this is not in the ſame manner in us, as it is in him: for he is righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous actually, we imputatively: he ſubjectively, we relatively in him and unto him.</p>
            <p>And ſo in theſe two laſt reſpects, we cannot be ſaid to be equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly righteous with Chriſt; though we be righteous with the very righteouſneſſe of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>He perfectly righteous, we righteous, by reaſon of our impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative and inchoative righteouſneſſe. Again, as Chriſt is called holy, and ſinne, and is ſaid to know no ſinne, and to be made ſinne:</p>
            <p>We muſt thus underſtand it, Holy in himſelf, and ſinne in us, not by infuſion of our ſinnes into his moſt ſacred perſon, but by the imputation of our ſinnes, and the acceptation of the guilt and puniſhment thereof upon himſelf;</p>
            <p>So likewiſe we are ſaid to be juſt and ſinfull: juſt in him by the imputation and application of his juſtice, and ſinfull in our ſelves, by the inbred corruption of our own fleſh.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, The finall cauſe of our juſtification actively conſidered, is the glory of God, which he acquired unto himſelf, by that wonderfull compoſition of his Juſtice and Mercy towards men: Juſtice, that he would have his own Sonne to dye, to make ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for our ſinnes; rather than our ſinnes ſhould eſcape unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed;</p>
            <p>And Mercy, that he would have the righteouſneſſe of his Sonne, to be imputed unto his Servants; rather than we poor ſlaves ſhould be deſtroyed for our ſinnes.</p>
            <pb n="73" facs="tcp:168495:44"/>
            <p>And thus much briefly of the cauſes of our juſtification active<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidered, in reſpect of God.</p>
            <p>Now in the ſecond place, we muſt conſider the cauſes of our juſtification paſſively, in reſpect of man.</p>
            <p>And firſt, The efficient cauſe of our juſtification paſſively con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, is wholly Inſtrumentall, and it is two fold: Firſt, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, which is the preaching of the Word and the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sacraments: Theſe are the chief outward Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which God uſeth for the application of Chriſts righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe for the juſtification of his Servants; and therefore the Goſpell is called, <hi>the word of life, Acts</hi> 5.10, 13, 16. And <hi>the Miniſtery of Reconciliation,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.18. And the Sacraments are called, <hi>the Seals of the righteouſneſſe of Faith,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And our Saviour ſaith of the Preachers of the Goſpell, <hi>That whoſe ſinnes they remit, they are remitted, &amp;c. Mat.</hi> 18.18.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Internall Inſtrument, whereby we apprehend the Grace of juſtification is only Faith in Jeſus Chriſt: <hi>For Chriſt is ſet forth to be our reconciliation through Faith in his Blood, Rom.</hi> 3.25. <hi>John</hi> 1.12. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3 24.</p>
            <p>And therefore, the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt is called, <hi>the righteouſneſſe of Faith:</hi> and we are ſaid to receive Chriſt by Faith, and to receive the promiſe of the Spirit by Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Faith is the only Inſtrument, whereby we are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied before God; the Scriptures are plain and plentifull in this point, <hi>Eſ.</hi> 45.24, 25. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20 44. <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24, 26. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.39.</p>
            <p>And ſo in many other places the Apoſtle doth inculcat the ſame truth, as <hi>Gal.</hi> 4 5, 24. and our Saviour ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 3.14, 15.</p>
            <p>That is, be juſtified and ſo be ſaved only by believing in him; as thoſe Iſraelites that were bitten by thoſe fiery Serpents, <hi>Numb.</hi> 21.9. were healed and ſo ſaved alive, only by looking up to the brazen Serpent.</p>
            <p>The Fathers alſo are plain and pregnant herein, <hi>Chryſoſt. in Rom. cap.</hi> 3. <hi>idem. Serm. de fide &amp; luce nat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Saith, <hi>God hath juſtified us, uſing thereto no works of ours; but only requiring faith in Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="74" facs="tcp:168495:45"/>
            <p>And without Faith no man obteined life.</p>
            <p>But I am able to ſhew, that a faithfull man hath lived and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined the Kingdome of Heaven without works; ſo the Thief did only believe and was juſtified: And <hi>Baſil. in Serm. de humilitate</hi> ſaith, <hi>This is to glory in the Lord, when a man doth not boaſt of his own righteouſneſſe; but doth acknowledge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf deſtitute of righteouſneſſe and juſtified only by faith of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, the material cauſe of our juſtification paſſively con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, or the perſons, to whom juſtification doe belong, are theſe ſheep of Chriſt that are known of him, and he known to them, <hi>who hear his voice and follow him, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whom he predeſtinated unto life, and elected to be juſtified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the foundation of the World, Rom.</hi> 8.30. <hi>Whom he did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinate, them alſo he juſtified:</hi> And <hi>Rodolph in Levit. lib.</hi> 17. <hi>chap.</hi> 2. ſaith, <hi>That the blood of the High-Prieſt was the expiation of the ſinnes of all Believers;</hi> and ſo Chriſt he hath taken away from the Elect, not only originall ſinne, but alſo all actuall ſins, that is, in reſpect of the guilt and puniſhment and dominion of ſinne, but not in reſpect of the corruption and pollution of ſin, which ſtill remaineth in the beſt Saints; <hi>And hath likewiſe given to them everlaſting life,</hi> ſaith <hi>Haymo in Rom. cap.</hi> 5. and to none elſe doth juſtification appertain; and the Reaſons may be theſe.</p>
            <p>All thoſe that are juſtified ſhall be glorified; <hi>For whom he juſtifieth, them he glorifieth, Rom.</hi> 8.30. but all men ſhall not be glorified, <hi>becauſe the Kingdome of Heaven ſhall be given but only unto them for whom it is prepared, Mat.</hi> 20.23.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Becauſe Chriſt is called Jeſus, for that he ſhould ſave his people from their ſins, Mat.</hi> 1.21. But though all men are his people <hi>jure creationis,</hi> by right of creation, yet all men are not his people <hi>jure donationis,</hi> given him to be redeemed; <hi>For of them thou gaveſt me, I loſt none, John</hi> 17.12. <hi>And ye belive not,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>becauſe ye are not of my Sheep, John</hi> 10.26. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſhall not juſtifie all men, thereby to ſave them from their ſinnes.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The formal cauſe of our Juſtification, paſſively con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:168495:45"/>is the particular application of the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, unto every faithfull ſoul; where theſe two things are to be conſidered; Firſt, That Faith muſt apply unto us all the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits that Chriſt hath effected for us. Secondly, That every man in particular muſt apply thoſe things to himſelf. For the firſt, This is one of the manifeſt differences betwixt the faith of Gods Elect, and the faith of Devils and wicked men, That the godly doe apply all the benefits of Chriſt unto themſelves, and the other know them, but have not the grace to apply them; for ſo ſaith <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and <hi>Peter Lumbard, lib</hi> 3. <hi>ſent diſt.</hi> 23. <hi>That there is a great difference between him that doth believe Chriſt and him that doth believe in Chriſt; for the Devils believe Jeſus to be Chriſt, but they believe not in Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Becauſe it is one thing to believe God, another thing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that there is a God, and another thing to believe in God.</p>
            <p>For to believe God, is to believe, that he ſpeaks the truth in Scriptures; and to believe God, is to believe that God is:</p>
            <p>But to believe in God, is to believe with love; and, by loving him, to goe unto him, and to cleave unto him, to be made one with him, to dwell in him, and he in us; and this is that faith, by which a ſinfull man is inſtrumentally juſtified and accounted righteous in Gods ſight.</p>
            <p>For the ſecond, We muſt underſtand, that this application of Faith, or of Chriſt through Faith, muſt be particularly applied by every man unto himſelf, and that in a moſt ſpeciall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;</p>
            <p>Becauſe a generall Faith is not the right juſtifying Faith; For St. <hi>Paul</hi> teſtifieth, that <hi>Agrippa</hi> did believe the Prophets, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.27.28.</p>
            <p>And yet <hi>Agrippa</hi> confeſſeth that he was no Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>And a naturall man, by the force of reaſon, may be induced to acknowledge a God, and that this God is powerfull, juſt, and true, and therefore to a generall perſwaſion of the truth of ſuch things as are to be believed.</p>
            <p>And yet all this faith is not ſufficient to juſtifie us;</p>
            <p>Becauſe the true juſtifying Faith is no natural quality, but a
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:168495:46"/>ſupernatural gift of God, as the Apoſtle teacheth, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.29. and therefore the generall faith of the Scriptures is not ſufficient to make us Chriſtians; but as we read, the Saints of God doe apply the promiſes of Salvation unto themſelves, as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>God is my Rock and my Redeemer;</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> 19.25. <hi>I know that my Redeemer liveth;</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> ſaith <hi>My Soul rejoyceth in God my Saviour, Luke</hi> 1.47. and <hi>I homas</hi> ſaith <hi>My Lord and my God. John</hi> 21. and <hi>Paul, Galat.</hi> 2.20. <hi>Chriſt lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved me and gave himſelf for me:</hi> So muſt every Chriſtian that looks for ſalvation apply in particlar the grace and favour of God to himſelf; and this faith inſtrumentally juſtifieth the ſinner.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, The finall cauſe of our Juſtification, paſſively conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, is peace of Conſcience in this life, and the attonement of eternal happineſſe in the life to come.</p>
            <p>The firſt is attained unto by two eſpeciall things:</p>
            <p>Firſt, by an aſſured perſwaſion, that all our ſinnes are forgiven us; So being juſtified by Faith, that is, from all the ſinnes that we have committed, we have peace towards God through Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, by an unwearied ſtudy, to ſtrive againſt the ſtream of our own natural corruptions, and to keep a conſtant courſe in the waies of godlineſſe:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For Chriſt gave himſelf for us, and did bear our ſinnes in his body upon the tree, that we being dead to ſinne ſhould live unto righteouſneſſe,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet</hi> 2.24. or as <hi>Zanch.</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Luke</hi> 74.75. and ſo St. <hi>Auguſt.</hi> That Chriſt died for the wicked, not that they ſhould remain wicked, but that they being juſtified through faith, ſhould be converted from their wickedneſſe, and bring forth the fruits of holineſſe; Becauſe, as St. <hi>Auguſt.</hi> ſaith, <hi>alſo grace juſtifieth that we might live justly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond end of our Juſtification is, That the eternall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe, which ſhall be attained hereafter, when Chriſt ſhall ſay unto all his juſtified Saints, <hi>Come ye bleſſed, &amp;c. Matthew</hi> 25.34.</p>
            <p>And ſo much for all the Cauſes of our Juſtification actively and paſſively conſidered.</p>
            <pb n="77" facs="tcp:168495:46"/>
            <p>And I hope this may ſuffice for the proof of the truth of this laſt Branch of the ſecond Poſition, That we are only juſtified by the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>I ſhall end with that of our Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 12.48. <hi>The word that I have ſpoken, the ſame ſhall judge you in the laſt day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I pray God to enable us all to hold the unity of the ſpirit in the bond of peace, and that we may renounce all thoſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines that ſets up any thing of man, to the abaſing of Chriſt; And that we may imbrace thoſe Doctrines that abaſes man and exalts the Lord, according to that of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Not unto us Lord, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory, &amp;c. Pſalme</hi> 115 1.</p>
